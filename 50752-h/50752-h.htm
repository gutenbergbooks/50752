<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Alaska and the opposite parts of Asia hold, in all probability, the
key to the problem of the peopling of America. It is here, and here
alone, where a land of another continent approaches so near to
America that a passage of man with primitive means of navigation
and provisioning was possible. All the affinities of the American
native point toward the more eastern parts of Asia. In Siberia,
Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria, Formosa, and in some of the islands
off southeastern Asia, living remnants of the same type of man as
the American aborigines are to this day encountered, and it is here
in the farthest northwest where actual passings of parties of natives
between the Asiatic coast and the Bering Sea islands and between
the latter and the American coasts have always, since these parts were
known, been observed and are still of common occurrence.</p>

<p>With these facts before them, the students of the peopling of this
continent were always drawn strongly to Alaska and the opposite
parts of Asia; but the distances, the difficulties of communication,
and the high costs of exploration in these far-off regions have proven
a serious hindrance to actual investigation. As a result, but little
direct, systematic, archeological or anthropological (somatological)
research has ever been carried out in these regions; though since
Bering's, Cook's, and Vancouver's opening voyages to these parts a
large amount of general, cultural, and linguistic observations on the
natives has accumulated.</p>

<p>For these observations, which are much in need of a compilation
and critical analysis, science is indebted to the above-named captains;
to the subsequent Russian explorers, and especially to the Russian
clerics who were sent to Alaska as missionaries or priests to the
natives; to various captains, traders, agents, miners, soldiers, and
men in collateral branches of science, who came in contact with the
aborigines; to special United States Government exploratory expeditions,
with an occasional participation of the Biological Survey
and the Smithsonian Institution, such as resulted in the fine "Corwin"
reports and the highly valuable accounts of Leffingwell, Dall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Nelson, and Murdoch; to the separate pieces of scientific work by men
such as Gordon and Jennes; and to Jochelson and Bogoras of the
Jesup exploring expedition of the American Museum.</p>

<p>As a result of all these contributions, it may be said that there has
been established a fair cultural and linguistic knowledge of the Aleut,
the Eskimo, and the Chukchee, not to speak of the Tlingit, consideration
of which seems more naturally to fall with that of the Indians
of the northwest coast.</p>

<p>There are also numerous though often very imperfect and occasionally
rather contradictory notes on the physical status of these
peoples, and some valuable cultural and even skeletal collections were
made. Since 1912 we possess also a good series of measurements on
the St. Lawrence Island natives, together with valuable cranial material
from that locality, made, under the direction of the writer, by
Riley D. Moore, at that time aide in the Division of Physical
Anthropology in the United States National Museum.</p>

<p>The need of a further systematic archeological and somatological
research in this important part of the world was long since felt, and
several propositions were made in this line to the National Research
Council (Hrdlička) and to the Smithsonian Institution (Hough,
Hrdlička); but nothing came of these until the early part of 1926,
when, a little money becoming available, the writer was intrusted
by the Bureau of American Ethnology with the making of an extensive
preliminary survey of Alaska. The objects of the trip were,
in brief, to ascertain as much as possible about the surviving Indians
and Eskimos; to trace all indications of old settlements and migrations;
and to collect such skeletal and archeological material as might
be of importance.</p>

<p>The trip occupied approximately four months, from the latter
part of May to the latter part of September, affording a full season
in Alaska. It began with the inside trip from Vancouver to Juneau,
where at several of the stopping places groups of the northwest coast
Indians were observed. At Juneau examination was made of the
valuable archeological collections in the local museum. After this
followed a trip with several stops along the gulf, a railroad trip with
some stops to Fairbanks, a return trip to Nenana, a boat trip on the
Tanana to the Yukon, and then, with little boats of various sorts, a
trip with many stops for about 900 miles down the Yukon. This
in turn was followed by a side trip in Norton Sound, after which
transportation was secured to the island of St. Michael and to Nome.
From Nome, after some work in the vicinity, the revenue cutter <em>Bear</em>
took the writer to the St. Lawrence and Diomede Islands, to Cape
Wales, and thence from place to place of scientific interest up to
Barrow. On the return a number of the more important places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
besides some new ones, were touched upon, while the visit to others
was prevented by the increasing storms, and the trip ended at
Unalaska.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey, the writer received help from the Governor,
officials, missionaries, traders, and people of Alaska; from
the captain, officers, and crew of the <em>Bear</em>; and from many individuals;
for all of which cordial thanks are hereby once more rendered.
Grateful acknowledgments are especially due to the following
gentlemen: Governor George A. Parks, of Alaska; Mr. Harry G.
Watson, his secretary; Mr. Karl Thiele, Secretary for Alaska; Judge
James Wickersham, formerly Delegate from Alaska; Father A. P.
Kashevaroff, curator of the Territorial Museum and Library of
Juneau; Dr. William Chase, of Cordova; Mr. Noel W. Smith, general
manager Government railroad of Alaska; Mr. B. B. Mozee,
Indian supervisor, and Dr. J. A. Romig, of Anchorage; Prof. C. E.
Bunnell, president Alaska Agriculture College, at Fairbanks; Mr. and
Mrs. Fullerton, missionaries, at Tanana; Rev. J. W. Chapman and
Mr. Harry Lawrence, at Anvik; Father Jetté and Jim Walker, at
Holy Cross; Mr. C. Betsch, at the Russian Mission; Messrs. Frank
Tucker and E. C. Gurtler, near the mission; Mr. Frank P. Williams,
of St. Michael; Judge G. J. Lomen and his sons and daughter, at
Nome; Rev. Dr. Baldwin, Fathers La Fortune and Post, Captain
Ross, United States Coast Guard, and Mr. Elmer Rydeem, merchant,
at Nome; C. S. Cochran, captain of the <em>Bear</em>, and his officers, particularly
Mr. H. Berg, the boatswain; Rev. F. W. Goodman and
Mr. LaVoy, at Point Hope; the American teachers at Wales, Shishmareff,
Kotzebue, Point Hope, and elsewhere; Messrs. Tom Berryman,
Jim Allen; and Charles Brower, traders, respectively, at Kotzebue,
Wainright, and Barrow; Mr. Sylvester Chance, superintendent
of education, Kotzebue, Alaska; the United States marshals, deputy
marshals, and postmasters along the route; and the numerous traders,
miners, settlers, and others who were helpful with specimens, advice,
guidance, and in other matters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks</span></h3>

<p>The account of the survey will be limited in the main to anthropological
and archeological observations; but it is thought best to
give it largely in the form of the original notes made on the spot
or within a few hours after an event. These notes often contain
collateral observations or thoughts which could be excluded, but the
presence of which adds freshness, reliability, and some local atmosphere
to what otherwise would be a rather dry narrative. A preliminary
account of the trip and its results was published in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Smithsonian exploration volume for 1926 (Washington, 1927, pp.
137-158).</p>

<p>Not much reference is possible to previous work of the nature
here dealt with in the parts visited, except in the Aleutian Islands,
where good archeological work was done in the late sixties by
William H. Dall,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in 1909-10 by Waldemar Jochelson.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The archeology and anthropology of the Gulf of Alaska, the inland,
the Yukon Basin, the Bering Sea coasts and islands, and those
of the Arctic coasts up to Point Barrow are but little known. The
archeology is in reality known only from the stone and old ivory
implements that have been incidentally collected and have reached
various institutions where they have been studied; from the excavations
about Barrow, conducted by an expedition of the University
Museum, Philadelphia, in charge of W. B. Van Valin, and by the
trader, Mr. Charles Brower, the results of which have not yet been
published; and from the recent diggings at Wales and on the smaller
Diomede Island by Doctor Jenness.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Neither Dall, Nelson, Rau, nor
Murdoch conducted any excavations outside the already mentioned
work in the Aleutians.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Northwest Coast&mdash;Juneau</span></h3>


<h4>THE COAST INDIANS</h4>

<p>Passage was taken on a small steamer from Vancouver. The
boat stopped at a number of settlements on the scenic "inside"
route&mdash;which impresses one as a much enlarged and varied trip
through the Catskills&mdash;permitting some observations on the Indians
of these parts.</p>

<p>The main opportunity was had at Aleut Bay. Here many British
Columbia Indians were seen on the dock, belonging to several tribes.
Names of these, as pronounced to me, were unfamiliar. They have
a large agency here; engage in salmon industry. A minority, only,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>full bloods&mdash;of the younger a large majority mixed (white blood).
The full bloods all show one marked type, of short to moderate
stature, rather short legs, huge chest and head, i. e., face. Color
near onion-brown, without luster. Indians, but modified locally.
Remind one (chest, stature, stockiness, shortness of neck and legs)
of Peruvian Indians.</p>

<p>Indians at Prince Rupert same type; color pale brown; eyes and
nose rather small for the faces in some, in others good size. Look
good deal like some Chinese or rather some hand-laboring Chinese
and Japanese look like them.</p>

<p>Indians at Juneau (the Auk tribe) very similar, but most mixed
with whites.</p>

<p><em>Juneau.</em>&mdash;A week was spent at Juneau, gathering information, obtaining
letters of introduction, and making a few excursions. The
city has an excellent museum devoted to Alaskan history and archeology,
under the able curatorship of Father Andrew P. Kashevaroff,
himself a part of the history of the Territory. The archeological
collections of Alaska Indians and Eskimos are in some respects&mdash;e. g.,
pottery&mdash;more comprehensive than those of any other of
our museums; but they, together with the valuable library,
are housed in a frail frame building, under great risks from both
fire and thieves. Fortunately the latter are still scarce in Alaska,
but the fire risk is great and ever present. The museum is a decided
cultural asset to Juneau.</p>


<h4>NOTES OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INTEREST</h4>

<p><em>Auk Point.</em>&mdash;Thanks to Father Kashevaroff and Mr. Charles H.
Flory, the district forester, an excursion was arranged one day to
Auk Point, approximately 15 miles distant, a picturesque wooded
little promontory near which there used to be a settlement of the Auk
Indians. On the point were several burials of shamans and a chief of
the tribe (all other dead being cremated), and near the graves stood
until a short time ago a moderate-sized totem pole. Of all this
we found but bare remnants. The burials of three shamans and one
chief had been in huge boxes above ground; but they had all been
broken into and most of the contents belonging to the dead were
taken away, including the skulls. The skeletal parts of two of the
bodies and a few bones of the chief remained, however, with a few
objects the vandals had overlooked. The latter were placed in the
Juneau Museum while the bones, showing some features of interest,
were collected and sent to Washington. A large painted board near
the graves of the shamans remained, though damaged. The totem
pole, however, had been cut down the year before by a young man
from Juneau, who then severed the head, which he carried home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and left the rest on the beach, from where it was soon washed
away. Thus a group of burials, the only ones known of the once
good-sized Auk tribe, have been despoiled and their record lost to
science. And such a fate is, according to all accounts, rapidly
overtaking similar remains everywhere in southeastern Alaska.</p>

<p><em>Rare stone lamp (?).</em>&mdash;At the museum one of the first and most
interesting objects shown the writer by Father Kashevaroff was a
large, heavy, finely sculptured oblong bowl, made of hard, dark
crystalline stone, decorated in relief on the rim and with a squatting
stone figure, cut from the same piece, near one of the ends. The
bowl looks like a ceremonial lamp, though showing no trace of
oil or carbon. Subsequently four other bowls of this same remarkable
type and workmanship were learned of, two, the best of
the lot, in the University Museum at Philadelphia; one in the
Museum of the American Indian, New York; and one, somewhat inferior
and of reddish stone, in the possession of Mr. Müller, the
trader at Kaltag, on the Yukon (later in that of Mr. Lynn Smith,
marshal at Fairbanks). The localities where the five remarkable
and high-grade specimens have been found range from the Kenai
Peninsula in southwestern Alaska to the lower Yukon. The Juneau
specimen comes from Fish Creek, near Kuik, Cook Inlet (see Descriptive
Booklet Alaska Hist. Mus., Juneau, 1922, pp. 26, 27); that
in the Heye Museum is from the same locality; the one in Philadelphia
was found in the Kenai Peninsula; while that at Kaltag came
from an old Indian site on the Kaiuh slough of the Yukon. Locally,
there is much inclination to regard these specimens as Asiatic, especially
Japanese, and a bronze Japanese Temple medal has been
found near that now at Juneau. On the other hand, a strong suggestion
of similarity to these dishes is presented by some undecorated
large stone lamps from Alaska, and by a class of pottery bowls with
a human figure perched on the rim at one end from some of the
Arkansas mounds, Mexico, and farther southward. (See Mason,
J. A. A remarkable stone lamp from Alaska. The Museum Jour.,
Phila., 1928, 170-194.)</p>

<p><em>Copper mask.</em>&mdash;Shortly before leaving Juneau I became acquainted
with Mr. Robert Simpson, manager of the "Nugget" curio shop, and
found in his possession a number of interesting specimens made in
the past by the Tlingit Indians. An outstanding piece was an old
copper mask, which was purchased for the National Museum.
Mr. Simpson obtained it years ago from a native of Yakutat and
stored it with native furs and other articles of value. It originally
belonged to a shaman of the Yakutat tribe and was said to have been
worn by him in sacrificial slave killings, the shaman with the mask
representing some mythical being. It is an exceedingly good and rare
piece of native workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Copper "shield."</em>&mdash;Another interesting article secured from Mr.
Simpson is a large old shieldlike plate of beaten copper, decorated
on one side with a characteristic Tlingit engraved design. Mr. Simpson,
in a letter to Doctor Hough, dated June 26, 1926, says: "The
shield, or to speak more correctly the copper plate&mdash;for it was not
used as a shield&mdash;was the most valuable possession of the Tlingits.
They were usually valued in slaves, this one, at the last known exchange,
having been traded for three slaves. The possessor of four
or five such plates was a man of the utmost wealth. Some claim that
they got these copper plates from the early New England traders and
others that they came from the Copper River. Either is possible.
Lots of the Copper River nuggets were very large and flat and could
have readily been hammered into plate form. I bought this in the
village of Klawak on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island. I
do not know of another one around here. All of the local elderly
natives are familiar with its previous value, and when they have
wandered into my shop to sell things they always made deep obeisance
to this plate."</p>

<p><em>Talks.</em>&mdash;While in Juneau the writer spoke before the Rotarians,
who honored him with a lunch; and later, in the auditorium of the
fine new high school, gave a public lecture on "The Peopling of
America," etc. The object of these and the many subsequent talks in
Alaska was, on the one hand, to reciprocate as far as possible the
kindness and help received on all sides, and on the other to leave
wholesome information and stimulus in things anthropological. The
audience was invariably all that a lecturer could desire, and many
were left everywhere eager for help and cooperation. The aid of
some of these men, including prospectors, miners, settlers, engineers,
foresters, and various officials, may some day prove of much value
in the search for Alaskan antiquities.</p>

<p><em>Juneau&mdash;Seward.</em>&mdash;June 8, leave Juneau. It has been raining
every day, with one exception, and is misting now, depriving us of
a view of most of the coast. Wherever there is a glimpse of it,
however, it is seen to be mountainous, wooded below, snowy and icy
higher up, inhospitable, forbidding.</p>

<p>June 10, arrive at Cordova, a former native and Russian settlement
of some importance. Will stay here large part of the day and
go to see about Indians, old sites, burials, and specimens, the main
hotel keeper, the assistant superintendent of the local railway, the
postmaster, the supervisor of the forests, and Dr. William Chase,
who has been connected with the work of the Biological Survey in
these regions. Mr. W. J. McDonald, the forester, takes me out some
miles into the very rugged country, where there are still plenty of
bear and mountain goat. After which Doctor Chase takes me to the
old Russian and Indian cemetery. There are many graves, mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Indian, but also a few whites, and even a Chinaman. Russian
crosses are still common. The older Indian part could be easily
excavated. Learn of skulls and bones on "mummy" island in Prince
William Sound.</p>

<p><em>Indians.</em>&mdash;See quite a few. Nearly all appear more or less mixed;
color in these more or less pronounced tan with red in cheeks and
some tendency to paleness. Heads still all brachycephalic and of
only moderate height; faces broad, noses not prominent, in males
tend to large.</p>

<p>Two adult men, evidently full-bloods&mdash;pure Indian type of the
brachycephalic form, head moderate in size, medium short, face not
very large, nose slightly or moderately convex, not prominent, but
all Indian. Color of skin submedium to near medium brown, no trace
of whitish or pink. Stature and build medium; feet rather small;
hair typical Indian, black, straight; beard sparse and short; mustache
sparse, no hair on sides of the face.</p>

<p>The boat makes two or three more commercial and passenger
stops before reaching Seward, the main one at Valdez, the terminal
of the Richardson Trail to the interior. These stops permit us to
see some fish canneries, which are of both general and anthropological
interest. These establishments employ Japanese, Philippine, and
Chinese labor, and it was found to be quite a task to distinguish
these, and to tell them from the coast Indians. The Chinamen can
be distinguished most often, though not always, the Japanese less
so, while the Filipino usually can not be told from the Indian, even
by an expert. Here was a striking practical lesson in relationships.</p>

<p><em>Seward&mdash;Anchorage.</em>&mdash;Seward found to be a fine little town, full
of the same good brand of people that one finds everywhere in
Alaska and who go so far to restore one's faith in humanity. It
is the terminus of the Government railroad to Fairbanks and a port
of some importance.</p>

<p><em>Indian basketry.</em>&mdash;No Indians were seen here, though some come
occasionally. But several of the stores, including that of the Seward
Drug Co. (Mr. Elwyn Swestmann), have an unexpectedly good
supply of decorated Alaska Indian baskets. It was found later, in
fact, that the Alaskan Indians, with the Aleutians, compare well in
basketry with those of Arizona and California.</p>

<p><em>Anchorage.</em>&mdash;June 12-13. Anchorage, on Cook's Inlet, is a good-sized
town for Alaska and the headquarters of the railroad. Here
were met some very good friends, particularly Mr. Noel W. Smith,
general manager of the railroad; Dr. J. H. Romig, formerly of the
Kuskokwim; and Mr. B. B. Mozee, the Indian supervisor. Here, at
Ellis Hall, I lectured on "The Origin and Racial Affiliations of
the Indians," and the large audience included seven male (some full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
blood) and two female (mix blood) Indians&mdash;of the latter, one very
pretty, approaching a Spanish type of beauty. Near town I also
visited with a launch two small Indian fishing camps. From Doctor
Romig information was obtained about the Indians and some old
sites of the Kuskokwim; and through the kindness of Messrs. Smith
and Mozee I was enabled to visit the Indian school at Eklutna. Here
at Anchorage I also was given the first and rather rare old Indian
stone implement.</p>

<p>The Indians at the camps included 6 full bloods&mdash;4 men, 2 women.
One of the men tested on chest. Typical full-blood results.</p>

<p>Type of full bloods: Color slightly submedium to medium brown,
never darker; heads, subbrachycephalic to full brachycephalic,
rather small; forehead in men more or less sloping in two; face,
not large, Indian; nose tends to convex but not high. Indian in
features and behavior, but features not as pronounced as general
in the States tribes.</p>

<p>The full bloods in town: Medium to short stature, not massive
frames, moderate-sized faces, Indian type, but not the pronounced
form; head brachycephalic; hair all black; mustache and beard
scarce, as in Indians in general; color of skin submedium brown.
Children in camp (up to about 5 years) were striking by a relatively
considerable interorbital breadth, otherwise typical Indian.</p>

<p><em>Birch-bark dishes.</em>&mdash;At Anchorage, in several of the stores, but
particularly at one small store, were seen many nicely decorated
birch-bark dishes or receptacles. They are made by inland Indians,
are prettily decorated with colored porcupine quills, and evidently
take the place of the baskets of other tribes. It was difficult to learn
just what Indians made the best or most, though the Tanana
people were mentioned. No such fine assortment of these dishes
was seen after leaving Anchorage.</p>

<p><em>Eklutna.</em>&mdash;Sixteen miles from Anchorage, along the railroad, is
the Indian village and school Eklutna. Mr. Smith made it possible
for me to reach this place on a freight and to be picked up later the
same day by the passenger train.</p>

<p>At Eklutna was found an isolated but prettily located and well-kept
Indian school, with about fifty children from many parts of
southwestern Alaska. More than half of these children showed
more or less admixture of white blood, but there was a minority of
unquestionable full bloods. There were two children from Kodiak
Island and two or three southern Eskimo. The main impression
after a detailed look at the children was that, while they all showed
clear Indian affinities and some were typically Indian, yet on the
whole there was a prevalent trace of something Eskimoid in the
physiognomies&mdash;an observation that was to be repeated more than
once in other parts of Indian Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Burials.</em>&mdash;At a few minutes' walk from the school at Eklutna
there is in a clearing of the forest a small Indian village, with a
late graveyard showing Russian influence. A short distance
farther, however, according to the Indians, there is an old burial
place of some magnitude, with traces of graves, although quite
obliterated.</p>

<p><em>Eklutna&mdash;Fairbanks.</em>&mdash;Since reaching Seward the almost incessant
drizzles have ceased and the weather has been fine and pleasantly
warm. Everything is green, grass is luxuriant, and there are many
flowers.</p>

<p>The railroad journey is a regular scenic tour, with its crowning
point a glorious view of Mount McKinley. The trains run only in the
daytime. For the night a stop is made at a railroad hotel, in a
quiet, picturesque location, at the edge of a good-sized river. They
have foxes in cages here and a tame reindeer. There are no natives
in this vicinity.</p>

<p>There are two interesting passengers on the train, with both of
whom I became well acquainted. One is Joe Bernard, an explorer
and collector (besides his other occupations) in Alaska and Siberia.
He furnishes me with some valuable pictures and much information.
The other man is Captain Wilkins, the flier of Point Barrow fame,
who strikes me as an able and modest man.</p>

<p>The next day, as the train stops at Nenana, I am met, thanks to a
word sent by Mr. Noel W. Smith, by Chief Thomas and a group of
his people. These behave kindly and tell me of a potlatch to be held
at Tanana "after some days," where they will visit. The chief impresses
me with his rather refined though thoroughly Indian
countenance.</p>

<p><em>Fairbanks.</em>&mdash;Before reaching Fairbanks, the inland capital of
Alaska, I am met by Prof. C. E. Bunnell, head of the Alaska Agricultural
College. This college, located on an elevation about 4 miles
out of the city, I visit with Professor Bunnell soon after arrival, to
find there some interesting paleontological and archeological collections.
Here are fair beginnings which well deserve the good will of
the Alaskans. Unfortunately the college has not yet the means
for any substantial progress or research in these lines, and the collections
are housed in a frame building where they are in serious danger
from fire. But their presence will aid, doubtless, in the saving of
other material of similar nature from the Tanana region, and specimens
of special scientific importance will doubtless be referred to
scientific institutions outside.</p>

<p>Fairbanks is a good-sized town, built on the wide flats of the
Tanana River. Its population, now reduced, includes some civilized
natives, most of whom, however, are mix breeds. A large petrified
mammoth tusk on the porch of one of the semi-log houses shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
that these are regions of more than ordinary biological interest. And
there is soon an occurrence which demonstrates this further. Mr.
John Buckley, the deputy marshal, takes me to an old Japanese
resident, now a rooming-house keeper, who has had a hobby of collecting
fossils, and who in the end is happy to donate to the National
Museum a fine skull of a fossil Alaskan horse, together with some
other specimens, refusing all payment. Such is the human Alaska,
or at least the most of it.</p>

<p>Here, too, to a full hall in the library, a lecture is given on "The
Peopling of Alaska and America," after which follows a return to
Nenana to catch a steamer to the Yukon.</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>THE WRITER'S TRIP ON THE YUKON</h2>


<h3>TANANA&mdash;YUKON</h3>

<p>June 17. Nenana: This is a small town on the Tanana, mostly
railroad buildings, with a hospital; there is one street of stores
(three short blocks), most of them now empty. About half a mile
off a small Indian settlement about an Episcopalian mission.</p>

<p>Country flat on both sides of the rather large river, except for
some hills back of the right shore beyond the railroad bridge, for a
short distance. The river flats seem scarcely 3 or 4 feet above water,
overgrown with brush and a few scrubby trees, later spruce thickets.
Purple flowers (fireweed) strike the eye.</p>

<p>No relics found at Nenana; no information concerning old sites or
abandoned villages along the stream.</p>

<p>Physically, the Indians seen at Nenana were submedium brown,
good many still full blood, pure Indian type, brachycephalic, faces
(nose, etc.), however, of but medium prominence. Moderate to good
stature.</p>

<p>They are all fairly "civilized," wear white men's clothing, to
which on gala occasions are added bands or collars of beadwork, and
speak more or less English. The younger men are evidently good
workers.</p>

<p>The distance from Nenana to Tanana is given as about 190 miles
by the river.</p>

<p>The government boat <em>Jacobs</em>, on which we shall go down the
Tanana, is a moderate-sized, shallow-bottomed stern-wheeler, and,
like all such boats on these rivers, will push a heavily laden freight
barge before it. There are about a dozen passengers, the boat
labor, a trader or two. All kindly, open. A few women&mdash;most of
both sexes of the Scandinavian type. On barge some horses, a cow,
pigs, chickens.</p>

<p>Leave after lunch&mdash;very good, generous, and pleasant meal in a
local restaurant that would do credit to a large city; only the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
are better, more human. Meals $1, the almost universal price in
Alaska.</p>

<p>Some quaint expressions: When anyone has been away, especially
to the States, they say he was "outside." I am an "outsider;"
show it "by my collar." Underdone bacon is "easy." To assent
they say "you bet." In a restaurant, to a decent, cheerful girl:
"May I have a little hot coffee?" "You bet!" Which bright
answer is heard so often that one finishes by being shy to ask.</p>

<p>Dogs, of course, do not pull, but "mush." This is from the Canadian
French "marche." Dogs do not understand "go" or "go on,"
only "mush."</p>

<p>Extensive flats. Below Nenana these flats, plainly recent alluvial,
are said to extend up to 60 miles to the left (southwestward) and to
20 miles to the right. As one passes nearer they are seen to range
from 3 up to about 8 feet above the level of the river at this stage
of water.</p>

<p>Cabins and fishing camps along the river, mostly flimsy structures,
with a few tents. Indians in some. The Indians are said by the
whites to be pretty lazy, living from day to day; yet they seem
industrious enough in their own camps and in their own way.</p>

<p>Storage or caches, little houses on stilts. Dog houses in rows.
Curious wheel fish traps, revolving like hay or wheat lifting machines,
run by the current. They scoop out the fish and let them fall
into a box, from which the fisherman collects them twice a day. It
is the laziest fishing that could be devised. The contraption is said
to come from the northwest coast, but has become one of the characteristic
parts of the scenery along the Tanana and the Yukon.
An Indian camp&mdash;stacks of cordwood&mdash;canoes.</p>

<p>The day is sunny, moderately warm and rather dry&mdash;about as a
warm, dry, fall day with us. The river shows bars, with caught
driftwood; also considerable floating wood. There are seagulls,
said to destroy young ducks and geese and water birds' eggs.
Shores now wooded, mainly poplar, not large. Farther back and
farther down, spruce.</p>

<p>The river averages about 200 to 300 yards but differs much in
places and there are numerous side channels (sloughs). It is crooked;
many bends. The current is quite marked, stated to run 4 to 6 miles
an hour. The water is charged with grayish-brown silt, part from
glaciers higher above, part from banks that are being "cut." The
banks are entirely silt, no trace of gravel or stone. Indian camps
getting very scarce. Boat making good time, but now and then requires
careful manipulation, with its big, heavy barge in front. Once
driven to shore, but no damage, and after some effort gets away
again. No trouble yet from mosquitoes, but there are some horseflies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Pass a large camp&mdash;a Finn married to a squaw, and three or four
Indian families&mdash;all snug in a clearing of the fresh-looking woods
on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Bend after bend in the stream, and boat has to follow them all,
and more, for the current and deeper water are now near this bank
and again at the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The water in many places is undermining the bank, exposing
frozen strata of silt. The top often falls in without breaking, with
trees and all, and it then looks like heavy, ragged mats hanging over
the bank, with green trees or bushes dipping into the water, and perhaps
a clump of wild roses projecting from the sward. There are
many low bushes of wild roses in this country, pink and red kinds,
now blooming. Also many small bushes of wild berries&mdash;cranberries
(low and high), raspberries, dewberries or blueberries.</p>

<p>Meat is imported even to here from Seattle, and carried far down
the Yukon. When received they place it in a "cellar" or hole dug
down to the frozen ground and place the meat there&mdash;a natural and
thoroughly efficient refrigerator.</p>

<p>Past Old Minto, a little Indian village, a few little log houses in
a row facing the river, with a wheel fish trap in front (pl. 1, <em>a</em>).
Later a few Indian houses and a "road house" with a store at Tolovana.
Most Indians there (and elsewhere here) died of the "flu"
in 1918, the bodies being left and later buried by the Government.
A few isolated little Indian camps.</p>

<p>The boat ties to trees along the banks. No docks or anything of
that nature. Not many mosquitoes yet, more horseflies, which, however,
do not bother man very much.</p>

<p>After reaching Hot Springs (right bank), there is seen a long
range of more or less forested, fairly steep-sloped hills along the
right bank, coming right down to the water's edge for miles, with
bush and forested flats opposite. At the end of one of the ravines
with a little stream, right on the bank, remnants of a little glacier
melting very slowly in the sun. Strange contrast, ice and green
touching. Boat making good time along the hills.</p>

<p>June 18. Hardly any sleep. Sun set after 10 and rose about 2.30,
with no more than dusk between. Then heat in the cabin, and above
all the noises. The boat stuck five hours on a bar and there were all
sorts of jerks and shudders and calls.</p>

<p>Flats again on both sides, but hills beyond, with just one little
spot of snow. Will be warm day again.</p>


<h4>ANCIENT MAN</h4>

<p>Prospects of old remains of man all along the river are slight if
any. Old silt flats have doubtless been mostly washed away (as now)
and rebuilt. Only on the older parts, now often far from water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
could anything remain and there it is all a jungle of forest with undergrowth,
with all surface traces absent (no stone, no shell), and no
one here to find things accidentally. As to the hills that approach
the river, the slopes (shales, overlain by what looks like stratified
mud and silt rock) are mostly of recent exposure, and have doubtless
been receding slowly through erosion, so that the bank line along
them is not old; and their valleys are few, narrow, and were higher
formerly as well as more extended toward where the river flowed
then. The only hopeful spot is about Hot Springs, where fossil
animal remains are said to exist, but here nothing as yet has been
noted suggesting ancient man.</p>

<p>June 18, 4 p. m. River getting broader. Some low dunes. In
distance a range of bluish hills before us&mdash;the hills along the Yukon.
Boat meandering from side to side. Every now and then a necessary
steam blow-out of mud, or a short whistle, hurry of a man over the
top of the barge and of two half-breeds along its side to the prow
to test, with long pointed and graduated poles, the depth of the
water, calling it out to the captain. The calls range from "no
bottom" to "4 feet," at the latter of which the boat begins to touch
and back water.</p>

<p>5 p. m. Arrived at Tanana, a cheerful looking town, extending
over about half a mile along the right bank of the Yukon, here
about 20 feet high; but now, with the gold rush over, rather "slack"
on both business and population, as are all other Yukon towns.
Somewhat disappointed with the Yukon&mdash;not as majestic here as
expected. See storekeeper&mdash;introduced by captain. Hear good news.
The Indians have a big potlatch at the mission, 2 miles above.
Tanana Indians expected. And there will be many in attendance.
Rumors of this potlatch were heard before, but this was the first
definite information. Get on a little motor boat with Indians who
were making some purchases, and go to the St. Thomas Episcopal
Mission, Mr. Fullerton in charge.</p>


<h4>THE INDIANS AT TANANA</h4>

<p>The mission above Tanana is beautifully located on the elevated
right Yukon bank, facing Nuklukhayet island and point, the latter,
according to old reports, an old trading and meeting spot of the
Kuchin tribes, and the confluence of the Tanana with the Yukon.
The mission house, located on rising ground, the wooden church
lower down, the cemetery a bit farther up, and the Indian village a
bit farther downstream, with their colors and that of the luxuriant
vegetation, form a picturesque cluster.</p>

<p>I am kindly received by Mr. Fullerton and his wife and given
accommodation in their house. On the part of the good-sized In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>dian
village everything is life and bustle and we soon are over.
Motor launches owned and operated by the Indians in the river;
dogs, scores of the big, half-wild, noisy sled dogs tied to stakes along
the slope of the bank, fighting stray ones, barking in whole outbursts,
feeding on smelly fish, or digging cooling holes into the bank
in which they hide most of the body from the warm rays of the
sun; and many Indians, about 400 in all, in whole families, in houses,
large canvas tents, cooking, eating, visiting&mdash;a busy multitude, but
with white man's clothes, utensils, etc., not nearly so interesting
as a group of more primitive Indians would be.</p>

<p>Walk, visit, talk, and observe. Note many mix-bloods, especially
among the younger ones and the children. Among the full bloods,
many, about one-half, with features reminding more or less of Eskimoid;
but a few typically Indian, i. e., like most of the States
Indians.</p>

<p>Medium stature, substantial but not massive build, quite a few of
the older women stout. Color of full bloods generally near medium
brown, features regular Indian but not exaggerated, noses rather
low especially in upper half, eyes and hair Indian. Epicanthus
not excessive in children, absent in adults (traces in younger women),
eyes not markedly oblique. Behavior, Indian.</p>

<p>The more pronounced Eskimoids have flatter and longer faces,
more oblique eyes, and more marked epicanthus. They should come,
it would seem, from Eskimo admixture. The Tanana Indians
(Nenana) did not, so far as seen, show such physiognomies.</p>

<p>Toward evening, and especially after supper, natives sing and
dance. Songs of Indian characteristics, and yet different from those
in south; some more expressive. A song "for dead mother," very
sad, affects some to crying aloud (a woman, a man). A wash song&mdash;a
row of women and even some men imitating, standing in a row, the
movements in washing, while others sing; humorous. A dance in a
line, curving to a circle, of a more typical Indian character. Late
at night, a war dance, with much supple contortion. Also other
songs and dances up to 2.30 a. m.&mdash;heard in bed.</p>

<p>June 19. With dogs barking and whining and Indians singing, got
little rest. All Indians sleep until afternoon. No chance of doing
anything, so go down to town to get instruments and blanks. Find
that storekeeper has an old stone ax&mdash;sells it to me for $1. Also
tells of a farmer who has one&mdash;go there with the boat and obtain
it as a gift; told of another one&mdash;a Finn&mdash;has two, sells them for $1.
Come from the gravelly bank of the river or are dug out in gardening.
There may well have been old settlements in this favorable
location. After return, visit some tents to see sick. Much sickness&mdash;eyes,
tuberculosis&mdash;now and then probably syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Indians relatively civilized, more than expected, and most speak
tolerable English. Have flags, guns, sleep in some cases on iron
beds and under mosquito netting, smoke cigarettes and cigars; and
even play fiddles. Of course some have also learned the white man's
cupidity and vices.</p>

<p>This day I met with something unexpected, due to perversity of
mix-breed nature. Seeing so many Indians present, and after a
good reception by them the evening preceding, I thought of utilizing
the occasion for taking some measurements. I therefore mentioned
the thing to some of the head men shortly after my arrival
and receiving what seemed assent, went to-day to Tanana to
get my instruments. On coming back and finding a few of the old
men, who were quite friendly, I invited them into the "kashim"
(community house) and began to question them on old sites, etc.,
when in came, probably somewhat under the influence of liquor,
a mix-breed to whom I had been introduced the night before and
who at that time acted quite civilly, but now coming forward began
rather loudly and offensively to question about what I wanted here
and about authority, giving me to understand at last quite plainly
that he wanted to "be paid" if I was to take any measurements.
He claimed to be one of the "chiefs," and I would not be allowed
to do anything without his help. His harangue quite disturbed
the other Indians, who evidently were both ashamed and afraid
of the fellow. And as I would not be coerced into employing and
paying him, and there being no one, as I learned, of supreme authority,
the "chief" of these Indians being little more than a figurehead,
it was decided to give up the attempt at measurements. The rest
of the visit was therefore given to further observations and to the
witnessing of the potlatch. Chief Joseph (pl. 14), nominally the
head of these Yukon Indians, expressed his sorrow and tried to
make amends by offering himself.</p>

<p>The potlatch was evidently in the main a social gathering of
the Yukon Indians, with the Tanana natives as visitors. It consisted
mainly of eating, singing, and dancing, to be terminated
by a big "give-away." This latter was witnessed. It proved a
disappointing and rather senseless affair. The whole transaction
consists in the buying and gathering, and on this occasion giving
away, of all sorts of objects, by some one, or several, who have lost
a husband, wife, mother, etc., during the preceding year. The possessions
of the deceased are included in this and doubtless often
transmit disease. All the color of the observance is now gone.
The goods&mdash;blankets, clothing, fabrics, guns, and many other objects,
even pieces of furniture, trunks, or stoves&mdash;are gathered in
the open and when the time comes are one after another selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by those dispensing and brought to this or that man or woman of
those who have gathered around. No song, no ceremony, no talks,
no thanking, no "wake" following. Just a poor shadow of something
that formerly may have been a tragic, memorable, and meaning
occasion.</p>

<p>Returned to Tanana near 10 p. m. and found lodging with a storekeeper
who kept a "hotel." Got a big room, big bed, and when
store closed was alone in the house, the storekeeper sleeping elsewhere.</p>

<p>June 20. But, Alaska was evidently not made for sleepers. Had
not a wink until after 3 a. m.&mdash;daylight, people talking loud and
walking on the board walk outside, and heard so clearly in my
room&mdash;loud-laughing girls, the dogs, and at last another boat with
its siren; and every now and then a singing mosquito trying to get
at me through even the small opening left under the sheet for
breathing&mdash;there being no netting. Finally doze off, to wake near
9 a. m., but everything closed, deadlike. However, go to a little
frame house for breakfast, and in waiting until it is made find myself
with two elderly men who go to-day down the river with their
boats. One is a former store clerk, etc., and now an "optician"&mdash;peddles
eyeglasses down the river; the other was a prospector, miner,
and blacksmith, now an itinerant "jeweler" and a reputed "hootch"
peddler. As the latter&mdash;otherwise a pretty good fellow&mdash;has a
good-sized though old boat, arrange to go down with him. See the
marshal, storekeeper, settle with my hotel man (had to go at 11 to
awake him), and ready to start.</p>

<p>The outfit is largely homemade, not imposing, old, unpainted, and
unfit for the rough&mdash;but it could be worse. It consists of a scow,
a low, flat-bottomed boat, partly covered with canvas roof on birch
hoops, in which Peake (the owner) carries fresh meat to some one,
a stove, dishes, bedding, and many other things; and the motor boat
proper, in which there is little room except for the machine and its
tender. The latter sits on a soap box; I, on a seat extemporized from
a cylindrical piece of firewood with a little board across it, with my
two boxes and bedding within easy reach. Sit in front of the scow,
except when driven back by spray. But our motor works and so we
start quite well at some time after 11. The arrangement is to stop at
every white man's camp or settlement down to Ruby. I could have
gone on a better boat with its owner, but they charge here $15 a day,
with "keep," and twice the amount for the return of the man and
the boat, which is beyond my resources.</p>

<p>Tanana&mdash;Ruby. The river is clearer than the Tanana, and much
broader. It is a great fine stream and its shores, while mostly still
low on the left, on the right rise here and there into moderate loess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
bluffs, far beyond which are seen higher elevations and bluish forested
mountains. All covered with poplar and spruce.</p>

<p>2.15 p. m. Wind has so increased that the scow bumps and squeaks
and there is danger of opening its seams. Therefore side to the
beach and make lunch&mdash;a roast of fat pork, over-salted, canned
spinach, dry bread, and black coffee. All on a simple, old, but efficient
little stove in the boat. Our companion, the oculist, rides not
with us but in a nice little green canoe with a plaything of a gasoline
motor fastened to the backboard, but we all eat and sleep together.</p>

<p>But a few small Indian camps seen, and no white man's house.
Soon after lunch, however, approach "The Old Station," where
there are a few Indian houses, and later a white man's place (Burchell's).
Stop at the latter. Learn that we are 20 miles from
Tanana and on a 5-mile-long channel. There are here 15 to 40 feet
high loess-like (silt) bluffs with a flat on the top, which latter
was from far back one of the most important sites of the Indians
of these regions. Mr. Burchell and his partner kindly take me back,
with their better boat, to the main old site. Many old graves there,
a few still marked. Traces of dugouts (birch-bark lined), houses,
caches, etc., from Burchell's place to old main site. Important
place that deserves to be thoroughly excavated, though this will
entail no little work. Site was of the choicest, dominant, healthy.
Connects by a trail, still traceable, with the Koyukuk region.</p>

<p>There are said to be no traces of pottery in any of these parts.
But average to very large stone axes are washed out occasionally
from the banks, and other articles are dug out (long ivory spear,
bone scraper, etc.). Promise of bones, etc., by Mr. Burchell.</p>

<p>One hundred miles more to Ruby. Near 8 p. m. start again&mdash;sun
still high, little wind&mdash;endeavor to get to the "bone yard," a great
bank bearing fossils. Fine clean scenery, flat on left, flat to elevated
with grey-blue mountainous beyond on right. Water now calm and
we make good progress. Very few camps&mdash;dogs on the beach, fish-drying
racks a little farther, then a little log cabin and perhaps a
tent, with somewhere near by in the river the inevitable fish wheel,
turning slowly with the current.</p>

<p>Had supper at Burchell's; white fish, boiled potato, coffee, some
canned greens.</p>

<p>Scenery in spots precious, virginal, flat at the river, elevated behind,
foreground covered by the lighter green of poplars and birches,
with upright, somber, dark spruce behind. Sun on the right, half
moon on the left, and river like a big glassy lake, just rippling a
little here and there. Cooler&mdash;need a coat. On right, getting
gradually nearer the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Near 10 p. m. Sun still above horizon. On left a long (several
miles), mostly wooded, but here and there denuded, palisade-like
bank, apparently 200-400 feet high&mdash;the "graveyard."</p>

<p>Monday, June 21. Just at sunset last night&mdash;after 10 o'clock&mdash;came
to the "bone yard" bank&mdash;a long curving line of loess bluffs
100 to 300 feet high, steep right to water's edge, riven by many ravines.
Lowest third (approximately) light compact loess; then a
thick layer of river sand (stratified more or less) and small gravel,
then from one-third to nearly two-fifths of darker loess. In spots
quite dark, frozen, but on surface melting, "running," also tumbling
in smaller or larger masses. Wherever darker there emanates from
it and spreads far out over the river a decided mummy-like smell.
Too late to photograph from boat, and no other place available.
Also impracticable to explore with any detail&mdash;would take several
days and be a difficult work. The bluffs become gradually lower
downstream. No bones seen from boat, but mostly were not near
enough to discern. A remarkable formation, in many ways, and
in need of masterly study as well as description.</p>

<p>Night on a low gravelly and pebbly beach. Many mosquitoes.
Mosquito netting found bad&mdash;sides too short (gave directions, but
they were disregarded) and mesh not small enough. In a short time
impossible to stay under. Supplemented by old netting of Mr.
Peake, who will sleep under his canvas in the boat; but the old dirty
net has holes in it and the mosquitoes keep on coming through the
two. Fighting them until some time after midnight, then under all
my things&mdash;netting, blanket, clothes&mdash;find some rest, sleeping until
4.30 a. m. After that&mdash;full day, of course&mdash;sleep impossible. The
"optician," who slept well under proper Alaska netting, gets up,
wakes my man; we both get up, shake, roll up bedding, have a cat-wash,
then breakfast, and at 6.30 off once more along the beautiful
but not hospitable river.</p>

<p>Inquiry at a local white man's cabin about fossils and Indian
things negative&mdash;has paid no attention, and fossil bones that he
sometimes comes across generally not in good state of preservation.</p>

<p>Right bank now hilly, with greater hills and then mountains behind.
Warm, river smooth, just a light breeze. How puny we are
in all this greatness.</p>

<p>A lot of trouble develops with the engine to-day&mdash;bad pump.
Will not get to Ruby until evening. Meat, on which I must sit
occasionally, begins to smell, and there are numerous horseflies,
probably attracted by the smell.</p>

<p>Four p. m. Visit Kokrines, on a high bank, native village, cemetery.
Photograph some natives, are good natured, talk pidgin English.
Clearly considerable old Eskimo admixture, but the substratum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and main portion is Indian. All kind and cheerful here, glad to
have pictures taken. Only white man is a "road-house" keeper;
i. e., storekeeper. Store, however, poorly stocked, probably in all not
over $200 worth of goods. "Optician," who is hoggish, has headache,
but eats and drinks all he can nevertheless. "Jeweler" repaired
his pump, and so we are once more on the way&mdash;35 miles more
to Ruby. No trace of any relics at Kokrines.</p>

<p>River now a mile wide, with many "slews" (side channels,
sloughs), and many low, flat, forested islands. Mountains to right,
higher, traces of snow. Smoke wall from forest fire advancing from
the west&mdash;now also smell. Islands beautiful, fresh colors and clean&mdash;light
grass on border, then green and grayish poplars, birches, and
alder, from among which rise the blackish green spruces. Little
native fishing camps a mile or two apart, right bank&mdash;on left wilderness
of flats, as usual.</p>

<p>A few miles above Ruby conditions change&mdash;high bluffs (rocky)
now on left, flat on right side. Ruby, from a distance and after the
loneliness of the day, looks quite a little town on the left bank, at
the base of the higher ground.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ruby</span></h3>

<p>June 22-23. Our approach to Ruby was very modest. With
Mr. Peake paid off, we just sided against and tied to the bank, on
which are the lowest houses of the village, and carried out my boxes
and bedding on the bank. There two or three men were idly watching
our arrival. I asked about the local marshal, to whom I had a
note, and had my things carried to the combined post office and hotel.
In almost no time I meet Mr. Thomas H. Long, the marshal, become
acquainted with the people about, tell my mission, and begin to collect.
It does not take long for one properly introduced to be thoroughly
and warmly at home in Alaska. The first specimen I get is a
fine fossilized mammoth molar. It is brought to me by Albert
Verkinik, who was about to depart for some mines, but went back to
get the tooth. And he asks no compensation.</p>

<p>The parts of two days spent at Ruby were quite profitable. Visiting,
and in the jail, were several Indians who could be noted and
photographed. At the old jail there were two skulls of Indians
that were donated. The teacher had two of the characteristic Yukon
two-grooved axes. The postmaster, Mr. H. E. Clarke, gave a collection
of fresh animal skulls. Mr. Louis Pilback donated two mammoth
molars, found 2 miles up the Yukon on Little Melozey Creek,
about 8 feet deep, in the muck right over the gravel. Mrs. Monica
Silas brought me a good old stone knife. Several of the men took
me down to the beach to see a damaged fossil elephant skull, also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
see some fossiliferous workings above the town. Another party took
me a few miles up and across the river to see an Indian camp and
near by some old burials. The collections were sent through parcel
post; and the evening before departure I gave a lecture to an attentive
and respectful audience.</p>

<p>The town itself, however, is now a mere damaged and crumbling
shell of what it was in the heyday of its glory, during the gold rush.
Many of the frame dwellings and stores are empty; the board sidewalks
are rickety and with big holes; and in the air is a general lack
of impetus.</p>

<p>June 23. Failing to find another suitable boat, I once more made
an arrangement to go farther down the river with Mr. Peake and
his friend. Peake's boat and scow were not much to look at, and
the troubles with the engine, and with its owner's raw swearing at
times, were somewhat trying; but for my purpose the outfit did well
enough, and I was treated very well and given all needed opportunity
to examine what was of importance on the banks. I was
quite sorry when eventually we had to part company, and I know
Mr. Peake has not forgotten my quest, for I heard of his talking
about it to parties, with whom I was very glad to come in contact,
on the Kuskokwim.</p>

<p>June 23. The sunny evening of my second busy day at Ruby,
near 10 p. m., Peake unexpectedly comes to the hotel to tell me he
will be ready to start to-night, on account of quiet water. His
wash "is being ironed" and will be ready soon. The marshal comes
in, calls the prisoners to take down my baggage, and at 10.15, after
true, hearty good-byes, I am once more in the old scow. Then Peake
goes for his wash, with an Indian woman, and does not come until
near 11. River peaceful, sun shortly set, sky somewhat cloudy, forest
fire on opposite shore below still smoking a great deal. Leaving
good people at Ruby, who promise to help in the future. It is
getting much cooler after a pretty warm day. Will lie on the hard
boxes and try to get a little sleep.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 24. We went long into the night, then stopped
at a lone cabin. Up timely, but slow start&mdash;it is 10.10 a. m. before
we go. The time gained at night lost now&mdash;bad habits. Breeze up
the river, occasionally strong, but not severe.</p>

<p>The cabin was the "Dutchman's," or Meyer's. He came out at
1 a. m. to meet us, at the bark of his big dogs, a good-hearted,
weather-seared prospector, fisherman, and trapper of about 40, alone
with his huskies. Asked me into his little log hut, prepared a place
for my bedding on a frame, burned powder against the mosquitoes,
brought out from cool "cellar" a bottle of root beer he brews, and
then we went to sleep. But dogs kept waking us and Meyer went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
out several times to quiet them. Fall asleep at 3.20 and oblivious
until near 7. Meyer forces on me six bottles of root beer, I leave
him some prescriptions, and taking my bed roll we go down to the
boat. My men still sleeping, as I expected. And then slow awakening,
breakfast, and late starting.</p>

<p>Meyer never saw any Indian bones or stones, but promises cheerfully
to watch for them hereafter and to make inquiries. Of course,
he also, like so many in these lands, tells of a "prospect" of a gold
find, and is quite confident he'll "make good." As usual, also, it
is a "lead" that was "lost" and he believes he has found it. And
all the time the gold is inside, not outside, of these hunters of the
yellow star.</p>

<p>Hills on the right again; flat islands, banks, etc., on the left.
Meyer's is 18 miles down from Ruby, right bank. About 5 miles
farther down on the slopes of the right bank is a pretty little Indian
graveyard (pl. 1, <em>b</em>), and a little lower down there are three
now empty Indian huts.</p>

<p>Hills and mountains seen also now beyond the wide flats of the
left bank. The hills on right, along which we pass, are more or less
forested, but often just bushy and grassy. They rise to about 600
to 700 feet and the slopes are seldom steep. Along their base there
are many elevated platforms, low swells, and nooks, that could have
served of old&mdash;as they serve here and there now&mdash;for native habitation,
though only few could have accommodated larger villages.</p>

<p>Pass an Indian camp&mdash;the inevitable staked dogs; a swimming
boy&mdash;first being seen bathing in the open.</p>

<p>Whiskey Creek next. Sixty-two dogs, all along the bank, and
each one-half or more in his own cooling hole; holes they dig down
to near the frozen ground. A settler, and two Indians&mdash;a photograph.
No relics or bones now, but will watch; promise also to save
some animal skulls, etc.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock. Off again. Day better now, less squally, warm.</p>

<p>Hills above and below lower and earthy&mdash;loess, at least much of
it. The right shore is all along sunnier, higher, more beautiful, and
more open to wind (less mosquitoes). These are the reasons, doubtless,
why it was of old and is still the favored side for habitations
by natives as well as whites.</p>

<p>Just before reaching "Old Lowden," overtaken by a rather crazily
driven small motor boat with four young Indians, who hand us a
crude message for the storekeeper at Galena, telling him that a baby
in the camp is to die to-night. I offer to see the baby. Find a boy
infant about one year or a little over, ill evidently with bronchitis.
Father and mother, each about 30, sit over it brooding in dumb
grief, each on one side. Respond not to my presence, and barely so
to my questions. And when I begin to tell to the fellow who inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>prets
and is some relative that the baby need not die, and what to
do&mdash;I note that he is somewhat under the influence of liquor and a
little flushed&mdash;to my dismay he begins to rant against me as a doctor
and against the Government, and wants me perforce, seemingly, to
say that the child is going to die and die to-night. There are two
guns around and I almost anticipate his catching hold of one. The
gist of the piecemeal talk is that they believe I am a Government
doctor, who ought to stay four or five days with them and take over
the child's treatment, and yet the fellow insists that the child will
die before next morning. I do not know what they would say or
do to the doctor if he undertook to stay and the child died&mdash;or if it
recovered. It is dismal. They have the idea that the "Government"
is obliged to do all sorts of things for them, without being clear
just what, and that it does not do them. They believe, and try to say
so, that I am sent and paid by the Government to treat them.
Probably they have heard about the Government medical party that
is to examine conditions along the river this summer, and think that
I do not want to do or give what is necessary. I give all the possible
advice, but there is plainly no inclination to follow it. I offer
some medicine; they sneer at medicine. Even the father says he does
not understand it or want it. They are all surly and in a dangerous,
stupid mood. So there is nothing left but to go away as well as
one may.</p>

<p>On way down the bank a woman is seen cleaning and cutting
fish&mdash;knife steel, with wood or ivory handle, of the Chinese and
Eskimo type. A porcupine, bloated, and with flies and maggots on
it already about the nose, mouth, and eyes, lies next to the woman,
and its turn will probably come next after the fish.</p>

<p>Have modest lunch&mdash;canned pears, a bit of cold bacon left from
morning, a bit of cheese, and coffee; and start once more onward.
So much beauty here, and such human discord.</p>

<p>3.30 p. m. Passing on right bank a line of bluffs, wholly of loess,
about 200 feet high and approximately 4 miles long, and as if shaven
with knife from top to water's edge. After that flats only on both
sides, with but one hill far ahead of us.</p>

<p>Motor trouble again&mdash;same old pump; but not for long; in half
an hour on again. A steamer upward passes us&mdash;like a stranger, and
power.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Galena</span></h3>

<p>A little town (village), on a flat promontory. An old consumptive
storekeeper&mdash;no knowledge of any old implements or skeletal
remains. Lowden village moved here due to mine opposite and better
site. About 10 Indian houses here; inhabitants now mostly in fishing
camps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>From Galena down, low shores and islands as on the Tanana, as
far as can be seen, with mountains, grayish blue, in far distance
(and only occasional glimpses). River never less than three-fourths
of a mile and sometimes together with its sloughs and islands several
miles broad. Some geese; occasional rabbit seen on land; otherwise
but little life. First gulls.</p>

<p>The Indians at Ruby and Galena show here and there an Eskimoid
type, with the younger nearly all mix bloods (with whites). Full
bloods of same type as all along the river, brachycephalic, low to
moderate high vault of head, moderate to medium (rarely above)
stature, medium brown, noses not prominent, concavo-convex, moderately
convex or nearly straight, Indian cast of the face, but quite a
few more or less Eskimoid. Not very bright.</p>

<p>Sit in the bottom of the scow, in front, before the stove and make
notes. When we stop, jump out to tie the boat; when leaving, push
it off. Getting sunburnt dark. Forgetting once again that I have
a stomach or any other organ. Only sleep, never fully, much less
than ought to; but even that is somehow much more bearable here
than it would be at home.</p>

<p>6.45 p. m. Suddenly, after a turn, confronted with a steep rocky
promontory about 500 feet high&mdash;stratified mud rocks. On side,
high above, a tall white cross; learn later an Indian murdered a
bishop here. A little farther, on a flat below the slope, a small settlement.
A remarkable landmark, known as the Bishop's Rock. Afterwards
again flats, but some more elevated than before to the left.
River like a great looking-glass. Same character of vegetation and
colors as farther above, but details varied.</p>

<p>At Ruby had made a genuine, effective, Alaska mosquito netting,
and so now feel quite independent of the pest; also have two bottles
of mosquito oil, which helps. Fortunately on the water we are not
bothered.</p>

<p>Toward night reach Koyukuk River, and later on, Koyukuk village,
a pleasant row of houses, white and native, on a high bank. Here,
at last, pass one good night, sleeping under good mosquito netting
in the house and on the bed of an Italian trader. Also had good supper
of salmon, and good breakfast of bacon and eggs, and so feel
rested and strong.</p>

<p>Friday, June 25. But in the morning the sky is overcast and every
now and then there is a loose shower. Of course my boon companions
are not ready again until long after 9 o'clock, and then the engine will
not go again, so a longer delay. They were inclined, in fact, to
"lay over," but I urged them on. But they are determined if it rains
a bit more to "tie to" somewhere. Fortunately there is no wind.
About 3 miles below Koyukuk and its flats, the high bluffs with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
steep more or less shaved-like barren slopes recommence. A gloomy
day.</p>

<p>About 7 miles down, after a large rocky promontory, a small graveyard
on the side of a hill, with a little native camp about a third of a
mile beyond.</p>

<p>10.45 a. m. Beautiful wooded great hills, 400 to 800 feet high, all
along the right bank again, with large <strong>V</strong>-shaped valleys between. A
fine, rounded, slightly more than usually elevated island ahead. Left
banks flat.</p>

<p>Sun coming out a little; cool, but not unpleasant. No more
showers, river smooth, boat making time. Blue hazy mountains far
to the left front.</p>

<p>Hills to right rocky, strata horizontal to warped, mud rocks, broad
banks of sandy, gravelly or mucky materials, not consolidated, between
hard strata.</p>

<p>Now and then a small Indian camp, usually two or three tents,
Indians, dogs, boats; some drying fish (not much).</p>

<p>11.00 a. m. Another isolated little graveyard, right slope, near an
old camp.</p>

<p>There is no possibility now of excavating any of these graveyards, for
the Indians are in unpleasant disposition toward the Government for
various reasons. But such a place as that near Burchell's could be
excavated as soon as conditions improve. Also that above Ruby and
another opposite and just below Ruby. There are no longer any
superstructures left at these (or but traces), and the graves, as seen
above Ruby, are near (within 2 feet of) the surface.</p>

<p>No trace or indication of anything older than the double-grooved
ax culture has thus far been seen anywhere in the valley; and large
stretches of present banks are quite barren.</p>

<p>As we approach Nulato the horizon before us becomes hilly and
mountainous. The sun is now fully out and its warmth is very
pleasant. Pass an Indian woman paddling a canoe; later an Indian
family going upstream in a motor boat. Most of these Indians
possess a motor boat of some sort, and know how to run it, though
it is not in their nature to be overcareful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nulato</span><br />

(Pl. 1, <em>b</em>)</h3>

<p>Arrive midday. Quite a village, as usual along the water front
on a high bank. Large fancy modern surface burial ground with
brightly painted boxes and flying flags on a hill to the right. Met
by local marshal and doctor; my things are taken to a little hospital.
Natives here have poor reputation, but now said to be better. Boys
nearly all mix bloods. Several men and women show Eskimo type,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
but majority are Indian to somewhat Eskimoid. Soon find they are
not very well disposed&mdash;want pay for everything, and much pay.
Have a few specimens, but to obtain anything from them is difficult.
Have been spoiled.</p>

<p>A visit with the marshal to the site of old Nulato on the proximate
point; nothing there, just a rabbit's skull and a lot of mosquitoes.
Photograph old graveyard (that of old Nulato), on the
distal point beyond the creek.</p>

<p>Mr. Steinhauser, trader, of Czech descent, helpful and kind. But
nothing further to do here. Steamer that was to be here to-night
or to-morrow will not arrive, just learned, until Tuesday (this is
Friday); and so must engage a little gasoline boat to the next station,
Kaltag, 40 miles down the river.</p>

<p>Sleep under my new netting in the hospital. In the morning, after
parting with doctor and marshal, start 8.30 a. m. Boat little, shaky,
run by a half-breed boy of about 18. My old scow with Peake and
his companion will stay a day longer. Partly cloudy, warm.</p>

<p>Pass flats, and come again to similar shaved-off bluffs like yesterday.
We are now running close to the shore so that I can see
everything. Flowers, but not many or many varieties.</p>

<p>9.50 a. m. Pass (about 8 miles from Nulato) a few burials (old
boxes) on right slope. (Pl. 1, <em>c</em>.) Indian camp about one-half
mile farther, and a few old abandoned huts and caches.</p>

<p>Everything on and along the river about the same as yesterday,
except in little details. Sky clouded; light clouds, however. The
boy with me has had good schooling (for a native) and is a good
informer. But there is little of archeological or anthropological
interest hereabouts. (Pl. 2, <em>a</em>.)</p>

<p>12.10 p. m. Another rounded island ahead of us; far beyond it
grayish-blue hills and mountains. Six miles more to Kaltag. But
little life here&mdash;a few small birds, a lone robin, a lone gull.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kaltag</span></h3>

<p>1.00 p. m. Kaltag in view&mdash;a small modern village on right bank,
less than half the size of Nulato; a nearly compact row of log and
plank houses. Nothing of any special interest seen from distance,
and but little after landing. The old village used to be somewhat
higher up the river.</p>

<p>There is an old abandoned site also just opposite the present
Kaltag. Another site, "Klenkakaiuh," is, I am told, in the Kaiuh
slough south of Kaltag, in a straight line about 10 miles, but no one
there; and several other old villages in that region along that
slough&mdash;same Indians as those of Kaltag. All of Kaltag go there
on occasions, but do not live there permanently any more.</p>

<p>At Kaltag Eskimoid features already predominate and some of
those seen are fully like Eskimo.</p>

<p>There is a tradition of an Asiatic (Chukchee) attempt at Kaltag
once.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon photograph some natives and go with
Mr. Müller, the storekeeper, and Mr. McLeod, the intelligent local
teacher, on the latter's boat, "hunting" along the banks up the
stream. Meet an old Indian (Eskimo type) paddling a birch-bark
canoe, said to be the only canoe of that sort now on the Yukon.
About three-fourths of a mile above the village see caved bank and
find a skull and bones&mdash;"split" old burial of a woman.</p>

<p>A canoe coming, so we all go farther up the beach, pretending to
examine stones. It is only the boy who brought me, however, going
home with some planks, and he grins knowingly.</p>

<p>After that we locate three exposed coffins, two undisturbed and
covered with sod. These two, for fear of irritating the natives, are
left. But the third is wrapped only in birch bark. It was a powerful
woman. With her a bone tool and a white man's spoon. With
the burial that had tumbled out of the bank there were large blue
and gray beads and three iron bracelets&mdash;reserved by the teacher.</p>

<p>I gather all the larger bones and we put them temporarily in a
piece of canvas. It is hard to collect all&mdash;the men are apprehensive&mdash;it
might be dangerous for them if detected. Everything smoothed
as much as possible, and we go across the river to examine two fish
nets belonging to the trader. One of these is found empty; but the
other contains five large king salmon, 15 to 20 pounds each, three
drowned, two still alive. The latter are hooked, hoisted to the edge
of the boat, killed with a club, and, full of blood, thrown into the
boat&mdash;great, stout, fine fish. To secrete our other findings from the
natives the storekeeper gets a large bundle of grass and ties it to
my package. We shall be bringing "medicine."</p>

<p>Arrive home, only to learn that against our information the river
boat has left Tanana on schedule time, is now above Koyukuk, and is
expected to arrive at Kaltag before 8 p. m. Hurriedly pack, a few
more photographs, supper, and the smoke of the steamer begins to
be visible. In a little while she is at the bank, my boxes are brought
down, a greeting with old friends on the boat&mdash;the same boat
(<em>Jacobs</em>) on which I went from Nenana to Tanana&mdash;and we start off
for Anvik.</p>

<p>Mr. Müller, the trader at Kaltag, German by birth, has a young,
fairly educated Eskimo wife, a good cook, housekeeper, and mother
of one child. The child is an interesting white-Eskimo blend.</p>

<p>In his store Mr. Müller showed me a good-sized heavy bowl of red
stone with a figure seated in a characteristic way near one end. The
specimen was said to have come from an old site on the Kaiuh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is of the same type as that at the museum in Juneau and the two
in the east, one at the Museum of the American Indian, New York,
and the other at the University Museum, Philadelphia. Regrettably
Mr. Müller would not part with the specimen. (See also p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>.)</p>

<p>The natives of Kaltag, so far as seen, are more Eskimoid than
those of any of the other settlements farther up the river.</p>

<p>Fine evening; sit with a passenger going to Nome, until late.
Learn that the boat to St. Michael is waiting for this boat and will
go right on&mdash;not suitable for my work. Also we are to stop but a
few minutes at Anvik, where I am to meet Doctor Chapman, the
missionary.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 27. About 5 a. m. arrive in the pretty cove of
Anvik. Received on the bank by Doctor Chapman, the head of the
local Episcopalian mission and school, and also the Anvik postmaster.
The doctor for the present is alone, his wife and daughter
having gone to Fairbanks, and so he is also the cook and everything.
In a few minutes, with the help of some native boys, I am with
my boxes in Doctor Chapman's house, and after the boat has left
and the necessities connected with what she left attended to we
have breakfast. I am soon made to feel as much as possible "at
home," and we have a long conversation. Then see a number of
chronic patients and incurables; attend a bit lengthy service in
Doctor Chapman's near-by little church; have a lunch with the
ladies at the school; visit the hill graveyard. They have reburied
all the older remains and there is nothing left. Attend an afternoon
service and give a talk to the congregation of about half a dozen
whites and two dozen more or less Eskimoid Indians on the Indians
and our endeavors; and then do some writing, ending the day by
going out for about a mile and a half along the banks of the Anvik
River, looking in vain for signs of something older, human or
animal. (Pl. 2, <em>c</em>.)</p>

<p>There are many and bad gnats here just now&mdash;how bad I only
learned later, when I found my whole body covered with patches
of their bites; and also many mosquitoes, which proved particularly
obnoxious during the lunch. As the doctor is alone, the three excellent
white ladies of the school, matron and teachers, invited us, as
already mentioned, to lunch with them. We had vegetable soup,
a bit of cheese, two crackers each, a piece of cake, and tea. But I
chose an outlandish chair the seat of which was made of strips of
hide with spaces between; and from the beginning of the lunch to its
end there was a struggle between the proprieties of the occasion and
the mosquitoes that kept on biting me through the spaces in the seat.
Chairs of this type, and I finally told that to the ladies to explain
my seeming restlessness during the meal, should be outlawed in
Alaska.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Anvik People</span></h3>

<p>The Anvik people, it will be recalled, were the first Yukon natives
seen by a white man. They were discovered in 1834 by Glazunof,
and since then have occupied the same site, located favorably on a
point between the Anvik and the Yukon Rivers. They belonged
to the Inkalik tribe, a name given to them, according to Zagoskin,
by the coast people and signifying "lousy," from the fact that they
never cut their hair, which in consequence, presumably, harbored
some parasites. Their village was the lowest larger settlement of the
Indians on the Yukon, the Eskimo commencing soon after.</p>

<p>The Anviks to-day are clearly seen to be a hybrid lot. There are
unmistakable signs of a prevalent old Eskimo mixture. The men
are nearly all more or less Eskimoid, and even the head is not infrequently
narrower, fairly long, jaws much developed. The women,
however, show the Eskimo type less, and the children in a still smaller
measure&mdash;they are much more Indian. Yet even some women and
an occasional child are Eskimoid&mdash;face flat, long, lower jaw high,
cheek bones prominent forward (like welts on each side of the nose),
whole physiognomy recalling the Eskimo. The more Indianlike
types resemble closely those of the upper Yukon. There is perceptible,
too, some mixture with whites, particularly in the young.</p>

<p>To bed about 11. Attic warm and window can not be opened
because of the insects. Sleep not very good; some mosquitoes in
room anyway. Wake up after 3 and just begin to doze off again
when the doctor gets up. About 4 he puts his shoes on&mdash;one can
hear every sound throughout the frame house, even every yawn&mdash;and
then goes to the kitchen where there soon comes the rattling of
pots. At 4.30 comes up to bid me good morning and ask me if I am
ready to get up and have breakfast. A man with a boat is to be
ready at 6 to take me to some old site. So a little after 5 I get up,
shave, dress and go down. Another night to make up for sometime,
somewhere.</p>

<p>We finish breakfast and the doctor goes to look for the man, but
everything deadlike, no one stirring anywhere. So I pack my stone
specimens from the river above and the bones from Kaltag, etc. It
is 8 a. m. and then at last Harry Lawrence, our man, appears&mdash;having
understood to come about that time&mdash;and before long we
start, in a good-sized boat, up the Yukon.</p>

<p>Day mostly cloudy but fairly good; no wind. Must use mosquito
mixture all the time, even after I get on boat, but they quit later.
Am standing on the back of the boat against and over the "house"
over it&mdash;inside things shake too much and I can not see enough.</p>

<p>Passing by fish wheels&mdash;heaps of fish in their boxes&mdash;some just
being caught and dumped in. Picturesque bluffs passed yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
seen to be of volcanic stone, near basalt, not granite, with indication
of minerals. Passing close to vertical cliffs of fissured and fragmented
rocks 200 to 500 feet high&mdash;dangerous. Consolidated volcanic
ashes with inclosure of many bowlders&mdash;fine lessons in geology.
Slides of soil and vegetation here and there. Large spruces and
altogether a richer vegetation since this particular rock region was
reached. There was in fact a plain line of demarcation in the vegetation
where the rocks changed.</p>

<p>Sleepy. Afraid to doze and fall off, so go inside. But there the
motor thumps and shakes too much for a nap to be possible.</p>

<p>About 12 miles upstream from Anvik, on the north bank, the mineralized
rocks and tufa suddenly cease, to be superseded by a line,
several miles long, of sheared-off loess bluffs about 200 feet high.
Here the vegetation changes very perceptibly. Two mammoth jaws
obtained from these deposits have a few years ago been given to Mr.
Gilmore, of the United States National Museum.</p>

<p>22 to 23 miles up the river, north bank, a fine large platform and an
old native site. Many signs still of pit and tunnel houses. A little
farther upstream a hill with abandoned burials. Excavate a grave
on a promontory over the river&mdash;not very old&mdash;wet and not much
left of soft parts, but succeed in getting the skeleton. Fine middle-aged
adult, somewhat Eskimoid, about typical for this region.
Carry down in a bag, dry on the beach gravel. Lunch on beach;
cheese, bread, coffee. The site is known as that of the Greyling River.
(Pl. 2, <em>b</em>.)</p>

<p>Start back a little after 3. Very warm day. River smooth. Sky
looks like there might be a storm later.</p>

<p>Hear of pottery&mdash;40 years ago it was still made at Anvik. Was
black, of poor quality. The women used to put feathers in the clay
"to make the pots stronger." When buried it soon rotted and fell
to pieces. In shapes and otherwise it was much like the Eskimo
pottery. Its decorations consisted of nail or other impressions, in
simple geometrical designs, particularly about the rim. It was
rather gross, but better pieces did occur, though rarely.</p>

<p>It is becoming plain that there are no known traces of any really
old settlements along the present banks of the Yukon; nothing beyond
a few hundred years at most. If there was anything older no
external signs of it have been noted, and no objects of it have ever
been found. It seems certain that the stone implements thus far seen
were used and made by the pre-Russian and probably even later
Indians. They all belong to the polished-stone variety. No "paleolithic"
type of instrument has yet been seen.</p>

<p>It is also evident that the Eskimo admixture and doubtless also cultural
influence extended far up the river. The farther down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
river, particularly from Ruby, the more the Eskimoid physical characteristics
become marked and the Indian diluted, until at Anvik
most, or at least much, physical and cultural, is clearly Eskimo.</p>

<p>Have further learned quite definitely that native villages on the
Yukon were seldom if ever stable. Have been known (as at Kaltag
and elsewhere) to have changed location as much as three times
within the last few scores of years, though in general they keep to the
same locality in a larger sense of the word. Anvik alone seems to
have remained on the old site since the advent of the whites.</p>

<p>Anvik, Tuesday, June 29. Last night gave talk on evolution to
white teachers, etc. Quite appreciated, regardless of previous state
of mentality.</p>

<p>Caught up with some sleep, even though my attic room was so
hot that the gum from the spruce boards was dropping down on me.
Good breakfast with the doctor&mdash;canned grapefruit, corn flakes with
canned milk, bread toasted in the oven, and coffee.</p>

<p>Pack up my Greyling skeleton&mdash;much drier to-day&mdash;and dispatch
by parcel post, through the doctor as postmaster.</p>

<p>Photograph school children and village. Gnats bad and have to
wear substantial underclothing (limbs are already full of dark red
itching blotches where bitten by them) though it is a hot day again.</p>

<p>The full-blood and especially the slightly mixed children would
be fine, not seldom lovely, were they fully healthy; but their lungs
are often weak or there is some other tubercular trouble.</p>

<p>The color of the full-bloods, juvenile and others, on the body, is
invariably submedium to near medium brown, the exposed parts
darker; and the chest test (mine) for full-bloodedness holds true.
The young are often good looking; the old rather ugly.</p>

<p>All adults fishing now, the fish running much since a day or
two; all busy at the fish camps, not many, in the daytime especially,
about the mission.</p>

<p>At noon air fills with haze&mdash;soon recognized as smoke from a fire
which is located at only about a mile, and that with the wind, from
the mission. We all hasten to some of the houses in the brush&mdash;find
enough clearing about them for safety. The school here burned
two years ago and so all are apprehensive. Natives from across
the river hasten to their caches. Luckily not much wind.</p>

<p>After lunch children come running in saying they hear thunder;
one girl saying in their usual choppy, picturesque way, "Outside
is thunder"; another smaller one says, "It hollers above." Before
long a sprinkle and then gradually more and more rain until there
is a downpour followed by several thunderclaps (as with us) and
then some more rain. That, of course, stops the fire from approaching
closer and all is safe. Such storms are rare occurrences
hereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>My limbs are a sight from the gnats. Must apply Aseptinol.
Worse than any mosquitoes; like the worst chiggers. Poisonous&mdash;some
hemolytic substance, which causes also much itching, especially
at night.</p>

<p>Arrange to leave to-morrow. Good people these, unpretentious,
but white through and through.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence, the local trader, who with his boy was with me
yesterday, is going to take me to an old site down the river and then
to Holy Cross. Donates a fine old ivory arrow point from the site
mentioned. Doctor Chapman gives three old dishes and two stone
axes&mdash;haft on one of recent manufacture. The natives seem to have
nothing of this nature, and no old site is near. The nearest is
Bonasila, where we go to-morrow.</p>

<p>This is truly a fish country. Along the placid Anvik River fish
smell everywhere&mdash;dead fish on shore here and there, or fish eggs,
or offal.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 30. Hazy and cool, 52° F. Take leave with
friend, Doctor Chapman, then at school, and leave 8 a. m. for
Bonasila.</p>

<p>The gnat pest was bad this morning&mdash;could hardly load my baggage;
had to apply the smear again, but this helps only where
put and for a time only.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bonasila</span></h3>

<p>Close to 10 a. m. arrive at the Bonasila site. Not much&mdash;just
a low bank of the big river, not over 4 feet high in front, and
a higher rank grass-covered flat with a little stream on the left and a
hill on the right. But the flat is full of fossae of old barabras
(pit and tunnel dwellings), all wood on surface gone; and there is a
cemetery to the right and behind, on a slope.</p>

<p>Examine beach and banks minutely until 12. Modest lunch&mdash;two
sandwiches, a bit of cake and tea&mdash;and then begin to examine the
shore again. Soon after arrival finding bones of animals, some
partly fossilized; beaver, deer, caribou, bear, fox, dog, etc., all
species still living in Alaska, as found later, though no more in the
immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes and gnats bad&mdash;use lot of oil. Begin soon to find
remarkably primitive looking stone tools, knockers, scrapers, etc.
Crawl through washed-down trees and brush. Many stones on the
beach show signs of chipping or use. Very crude&mdash;a protolithic industry;
but a few pieces better and showing polished edge. Also
plenty of fragments of pottery, not seldom decorated (indented).
Make quite a collection. And then, to cap it, find parts of human
skeleton, doubtless washed out from the bank. Much missing, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
good bit recovered, and that bit is very striking. (See p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>.) Also
a cut bone (clean cut, as if by a sharp knife) in situ in the mud
of the bank, and a little birch-bark basket still filled with mud from
the bank, with later a larger basket of same nature in situ; could
save but a piece. Conditions puzzling. Was there an older site
under one more recent?</p>

<p>2 p. m. About 2 p. m. go to the cemetery. About a dozen burials
recognizable. A pest of mosquitoes and gnats&mdash;Lawrence soon
bleeds over face and neck, while I keep them off only by frequent
smearing. He soon has to smear, too. Open five graves&mdash;placed
above ground, wooden (split and no nails) boxes covered with earth
and sod. Skeletons all in contracted position, head to the east and
lying on right side. Some in poor condition. Three women, one
man, one child. Gnats swarm in the moss and the graves, and with
the smears, here and there a trickle of blood, the killed pests and
the dust, we soon look lovely. But there is enough of interest.
With each burial appears something&mdash;with the man two large blue
Russian beads; first woman&mdash;a pottery lamp (or dish), iron knife;
with the second two fire sticks, stone objects (sharpeners), partly
decayed clay dish; with the third, a Russian bead and a birch-bark
snuffbox; with the child a "killed" (?) glass bottle of old form
and an iron flask; in the grave of an infant (bones gone) a Russian
bead. A grave of a child&mdash;bones burned.</p>

<p>6.15 p. m. Rest must be left. Lawrence may be enabled to do
some work in the fall. Leave 6.15; carry quite a lot&mdash;in sacks, gasoline
cans, lard cans. Wonder how I shall be able to send things from
Holy Cross, and what next. Cool, sky overcast whole day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Holy Cross</span></h3>

<p>Thursday, July 1. Slept on the floor of a little store last night
at Ghost Creek. The Catholic mission at Holy Cross, with all sorts
of room, about 1½ miles down, and where, though late and tired, I
visited Father Jules Jetté, a renowned student of the dialects of the
Yukon Indians, did not offer to accommodate me, and the trader in
their village could only offer me a "bunk" in one little room with
three other people. So after 10 p. m. we went down to the "Ghost
Creek," where I was gladly given a little corner in the store of Alec
Richardson. Of course there were whining dogs outside, right next
to the store on both sides, and they sang at times (or howled) like
wolves, whose blood they seem to carry. And a cat got closed in with
me and was pulling dried fish about, which she chewed, most of the
night it seemed. So there was not much sleep until from about 5
a. m. to 8.30, after the cat was chased out and the dogs got weary.
Then no breakfast till near 9.30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Went to mission again to see Father Jetté&mdash;he is not of the mission&mdash;a
fine old Frenchman and scholar. He was not responsible for
last night and anyway I was spoiled farther up the river. His
meritorious work deserves to be known and published.</p>

<p>After a very simple lunch packed yesterday's collections from the
Bonasila site&mdash;five boxes. The parcel post here alone will cost
$20.40. How odd that the transportation of the collections of a
Government institution must be paid for from the little appropriation
received for scientific work to another department of the same
Government.</p>

<p>It is cloudy, drizzly, cold. Am endeavoring to leave to-morrow,
but they want $35 to the next station, and the boat does not leave
for St. Michael until the 11th. Fortunately I am able to send away
the collections, and there will surely be some way down the river.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ghost Creek</span></h3>

<p>July 1-2, 10.30 p. m. A night on the Yukon. (Pl. 3, <em>a</em>,) They
have lit a powder against the mosquitoes. Smear the many gnat
bites with Mentholatum&mdash;helps but for a while&mdash;and having now my
fine meshed netting, my own bedding, and a clean pillow, I feel
fine, safe from all the pests, and ready for a quiet night, all alone.</p>

<p>Commenced dozing off when a he-cat, who hid in the store at
closing, begins to make all kinds of unnamable noises. Stand it for
a while, but he does not stop and one could never sleep&mdash;so crawl
out from the bed, catch the beast, and throw him out.</p>

<p>In again and settling down, when another cat&mdash;did not know there
were two here&mdash;begins to mew and tries to force its way out under
the door, which is about 2½ inches above the floor. Persists until
I have to get up the second time. Throw that cat out and in bed
once more.</p>

<p>In a minute, however, the dogs outside espied the cats and began
a pandemonium of howls and yelps and barks. Try hard, but can
not stand it. Moreover, the last cat got on the roof, where I hear
him walking, and he seems in no hurry to get off. So finally have
to get out, catch the cat on the edge of the roof, throw him back into
the store, and to bed for another trial. But soon have to smear the
body; the bites itch too much. The sleepiness is now quite gone.
A mild amusement as to what next. It must be midnight or later
now, and it has grown cold. One blanket is not sufficient. Doze off
a little, wake up with cold, readjust blanket and flaps of bag, doze
off a little again&mdash;the dogs commence to howl, just for a song this
time, in two, three, then a unison. The bites itch bitterly, now here,
now there. The sun has risen; it is real cold, probably no more than
about 40° to 45° F. And so on until 5.30, when at last fall into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a deep, dreamless sleep, regardless of light, cats, dogs, and everything
and sleep until 8.30.</p>

<p>Wake up, can not believe my watch; but it goes, and so probably
is right. But no one anywhere yet stirring.</p>

<p>Dress, wash a bit in the muddy river; head feels as if it had been
knocked by something heavy. Make my "roll" of bedding and
then work on notes, putting down faithfully what has transpired.
About 9.30, at last, the storekeeper comes to say they overslept and
that a cup of coffee will be ready before long.</p>

<p>Friday, July 2. "Ghost Creek" was named so because of many
burials about the creek. The flat between the hills here is about
three-fourths of a mile long by the water front, with rising slopes,
and used to extend considerably farther out, but was "cut" or
washed away by the river. It has been used for a village site and
burial ground by the old Indians of the vicinity. As the banks
tumble away, bone arrow points, barbed and not, stone scrapers, and
other objects wash out. Graves are found in the ground as well as
above it. Russian influence prevalent in the objects buried with the
bodies, but site extends to pre-Russian time. Same type graves as
at Bonasila, with slight local modifications.</p>

<p>At Bonasila the burials above ground were in boxes of hewn wood,
joined somewhat as the logs in a log house, and without any base.
The body inside was covered with birch bark (three or four pieces),
then covered with the top planks, unfastened, and these in turn
covered with about a foot of earth and sod. At Ghost Creek the
same, but there is an undressed-stake base or platform on which the
sides of the "coffin" rest and with somewhat less earth and sod on
the top of the box. But graves differ here from underground and
birch bark alone (no trace of wood, if any was ever there; but
probably none used) to such aboveground as have iron nails and
sawed planks. Here, as at Bonasila, a few simple articles are
generally found buried at the head, and for these many of the graves
were already despoiled and the skeletal remains scattered or reburied.</p>

<p>There appears to be no line of demarcation between the underground
and aboveground graves; possibly the latter were winter
burials, but this must be looked into further.</p>

<p>The bodies here, except the latest, are buried flexed. Exceptionally,
both at Bonasila and here, the planks surrounding the grave
were painted with some mineral pigments which resist decomposition
better than the wood, and decorated in a very good native way with
series of animals and men, caribou, bear, etc. Too faint to photograph,
and too bulky and decayed to take away; but decoration much
superior to ordinary Indian pictographs, and apparently connecting
with the type of art of the northwest coast. It is of interest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
practically the same decorated burials were seen by Dall among the
Eskimo of Norton Sound (Unalaklik).<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In this case it was probably
the Indian habit that was adopted by the near-by Eskimo, for
none of the more northern Eskimo practiced such burials. The habit
was also known in southeastern Alaska. (Pl. 3, <em>b</em>.)</p>

<p>Jim Walker, the helpful local mix-breed trader, has dug out many
of these graves (alone or with Harry Lawrence), and a good many
of the objects are said to have been taken away by Father O'Hara,
formerly of the Holy Cross Mission.</p>

<p>According to all indications the stone culture of Bonasila and of
Ghost Creek (1½ miles upstream from Holy Cross) were related,
both passing apparently into the Russian period, and that at Ghost
Creek continuing down to our times, for there is still living here an
old man who belongs to this place which once had a large village.
Much could be done yet and saved in both places.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 3. At last slept, notwithstanding everything, and
succeeded even in being warm.</p>

<p>Breakfast 8.30, for a wonder. Two soft-boiled Seattle eggs, two
bits of toast with canned butter (not bad at all), some over-preserved
raspberries, and a faded-looking nearly cold "flapjack" with
sirup, also mediocre tea. But all goes here, and the stomach calls
for no other attention than to fill it.</p>

<p>Finishing work, getting further information from the old Indian,
writing, and waiting to go away with a trader to Paimute, the first
all-Eskimo village, 25 miles farther down the river. Rains occasionally,
but not very cold. Many gnats when wind moderates.</p>

<p>Lunch&mdash;canned sardines (in this land of fresh salmon!), a bit of
toast, some canned fruit, and that unsavory tea.</p>

<p>Have utilized this day in a profitable manner. Have learned
that there was another burial ground about half a mile farther upstream,
behind an elevation. So got a rowboat and with Jim
Walker's young boy rowed over. Had to wade through high grass
over a wet flat, and then up the rank grass and bush-covered slope,
and there found a number of old burials. All rifled, but most of
the bones still there. So send boy back, on the quiet&mdash;there is above
the store the camp of the old man with an old Indian woman and
sick girl&mdash;for some boxes, and meanwhile collect. It is an unceasing
struggle with the mosquitoes and gnats in the tall grass and weeds;
but one after another I find what remains of the usual old box
burials. The bones are mostly in good condition. The boy arrives
with several empty gasoline boxes, we gather drier grass and moss,
and pack right on the spot, eventually get to the boat, strike off as
far as possible from the shore so none could see what is carried, and
proceed to Walker's storehouse. Old Indian and his old crony
nevertheless stand on bank and look long at us. In storehouse boxes
closed, later delivered by the boy to the mail boat, and so that much
is saved; for were it not collected, in a few years the weather, vegetation,
and animals, human and other, would destroy everything.</p>

<p>Moreover, the utmost care is taken always to leave everything in as
good shape as found; and the remains taken will be treated so well
and may give us so much that we need that there is no more hesitation
in securing them than there would be on the part of a paleontologist
in securing old bones for his purposes.</p>

<p>For supper, though it is still early, am invited by Simel, an elderly
Jew mail carrier. Have fine meat-and-potato soup, lettuce-and-cucumber
salad (even if the cucumbers from the Holy Cross hothouse
are overripe and bitter), fresh (storage) meat, cooked dried
apples, and poor but hot coffee&mdash;all seasoned with the best will and
genuine, simple friendliness.</p>

<p>Max Simel, whose home is at Ophir, has been in this country 29
years, and "never needed to buy a quarter's worth of medicine."
Has a wife in Seattle, also a daughter and a son; has not seen them
for four years. Wants me to call on them and tell them I met him.
With his companion, Paul Keating, of Holikachakat, gives me some
interesting information. They tell me independently and then together
of an occurrence that shows what may happen along this great
river. A well-known white man and woman, prospectors on their
mail route, have last year thawed and dug out a shaft, nearly 40 feet
deep, through muck and silt, to the gravel, in which they hoped to
get gold; and just before they reached the gravel they found a piece
of calico, old and in bad condition, but still showing some of its
design and color.</p>

<p>7 p. m. It rains, but wind has moderated, and so near 7 p. m.
we start on our way farther down the river, stopping just long enough
at Holy Cross to attend to my reservation for St. Michael. The agent
has no idea when the boat will go&mdash;maybe the 11th, maybe not until
the 14th or later.</p>

<p>Going on an old leaky scow with an elderly, faded, chewing, not
very talkative but for all that very kindly and accommodating man,
who with one hand holds the steering wheel and with the other most
of the time keeps on bailing. He carries supplies for his store and I
my outfit, camera, and umbrella. Sky has here and there cleared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
even patches of sun appear on far-away clean-cut hills. Water not
very rough; make fair time downstream. Banks flat now, river
broad, some hills in distance.</p>

<p>8.00 p. m. Hills nearer ahead of us. Some of the flats look from
distance like fine tree nurseries. Getting cool. Cloudy ahead. The
banks flat and low, no good site for habitation. Not even fishing
camps here&mdash;just long "cut-banks" (banks being cut by the river)
and low beaches. Here and there new bars and islands that are
being built by the river. No birds, no boats, just an occasional
floating snag or a rare solitary gull.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Paimute</span></h3>

<p>Paimute down river, I am told, has nothing but Eskimo; Holy
Cross, but a few natives now, mainly Indian; above Holy Cross,
Indian, Eskimo only as adapted or in admixture.</p>

<p>July 3, 8.30 p. m. Hills on right now right before us. Behind first
a fish camp of the Holy Cross Mission natives. River narrows and
bends. Two other fish camps become visible. Stop; damp, cold,
smoke, fish smell, a few natives, Eskimo. River now like molten
glass, but air damp and cold, and I must sit behind the engine and
keep my hands over the hot exhaust pipe to keep somewhat comfortable.</p>

<p>Pass bulging bluffs on right&mdash;old stratified shales.</p>

<p>11.00 p. m. Arrive at our destination about 11 p. m. But a few log
huts on the right side of the river, with few others and a primitive
frame church in the back. A little store and a big storehouse (with
skins, etc.), trader's house (log cabin) a few rods away. Open
store, only to find that a pup had been forgotten there, made a lot
of mess and dirt and ate most of one side of bacon.</p>

<p>12.00 p. m. Got to bed in the cabin at 12. Spread bed roll on
two reindeer skins which, with fire in the stove, keep me fairly warm.
Rain in night and several earth tremors&mdash;common in these parts;
feel several light ones every night and a stronger one occasionally
even in daytime (a big "fault" in the Alaskan range and a proximity
to the Aleutian volcanic zone).</p>

<p>Awake before 8, but as it still rains nothing can be done, while
my man within a few feet of me still snores; stay in blanket till 9.
Modest breakfast at 10 a. m.</p>

<p>10.00 a. m. A little house cleaning&mdash;watch kitten clean windows
of the many flies, which it eats; and then my man, a Swede by birth,
sailor, self-taught painter (of ships and sea scenes), and musician
(accordion), goes to bail out the boat. Still full of bites that itch
and need a lot of Aseptinol, which in turn makes underwear look
dreadful. And no bath possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Last night met some of the local Eskimo, full bloods, mostly from
the Kuskokwim River. Strong, kinder than the Yukon Indians.
But they differ but little in some cases from the latter. They are
medium brown in color, hair exactly like the Indian, beard also&mdash;only
the rather flat (not prominent) mid parts of the face, with
rather long and narrow (upper two-thirds) nose, and the cheek
bones protruding more or less forward, with face long (often), due
to the vertical development of the jaws, helps to distinguish them as
Eskimo. There is no clear line of demarcation between the Indian
farther up the river and the Eskimo down here, yet in some here
the Eskimo type is unmistakable. They have more epicanthus,
flatter, longer, and stronger (more massive) face, stronger frame,
rather submedium length of legs, and less brachycephalic (or more
oblong) head, but not the characteristic, narrow and high, keel-shaped
dome that one is used to associate with the Eskimo.</p>

<p>1 p. m. A little lunch&mdash;just a cup of coffee and a few crackers.
Photograph two natives.</p>

<p>1.30 p. m. Start toward Russian Mission. Trader carries sugar
in bags and tea for camps.</p>

<p>Near 2. Stop at an Eskimo camp, see sick baby, photograph a
few individuals. Get an ax for a pocketbook&mdash;old man happy as a
child at the exchange. Made another one happy this morning in
payment for information with one of my steamer caps. (Pl. 4, <em>a</em>.)</p>

<p>Pass along the still continuing bulging hills on the right. They
are forested over lower parts, barren, though mostly greenish, above.
As usual flats on left, devoid of man. Occasionally a fish camp on
right, or a small village, somewhat different, though in essentials
like the Indian (more gregariousness noticeable&mdash;up river mostly
individual or at most two or three families). Every favorable higher
flat or low saddle among the hills on the right and facing the river
(or a slough) is utilized by the natives, but such places are scarce.</p>

<p>The ax obtained looks as if it had been broken after found, to make
of it a single-edge tool. Tumbled out of a bank. Old Eskimo knew
not who made it. Found some miles below Paimute by the old man.
Others found, but lost. Ivory arrow and spear points also known
to natives, but no one now has any.</p>

<p>A mountain ahead of us. Sky clouded mostly, high diffuse vapors
and low, heavy but separated cumuli in the east; one would expect
soon a heavy rain. Visibility exceptionally good, horizons far
away, uncommonly clear. Mountains sharply outlined against the
sky.</p>

<p>About 12 miles below Paimute, on left, some higher banks (old silts
and dunes). The ax from the old man had been found here. Stop.
Find pottery 12 feet, charcoal 15 feet from surface. Also polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and worked stones. But most of bank has already been cut off and
what remains shows no signs of man on the top. (Pl. 4, <em>b</em>.)</p>

<p>Cross river obliquely to right bank, just beyond last ("12-mile")
hill. Find at once numerous evidences of stone work along the stony
beach. In an hour have a fair collection, mainly rejects, but interesting.
On top of bank find several mounds and ridges, doubtless dunes,
though the one farthest up the river looks very much like a large
oval man-made mound. Parts of two much-weathered skulls and
one bone lay on the top of this. No definite marks of graves excepting
perhaps in one instance. A sign of old clearing farther down,
but no "barabras." A spot well worthy of exploration. It was, I
learned a little later from Nick Williams, a native who used to act
as a pilot on the river, the old mountain village or "Ingrega-miut,"
and the site is 12 miles downstream from Paimute. (Pl. 4, <em>c</em>.)</p>

<p>Beyond are flats and cut banks, both sides, but with hills (old
water front) behind on the right and mountains in front. River
here very wide.</p>

<p>Many of the worked stones, and occasionally, according to native
information, skulls and bones, are washed out from the banks and
deposited (rolling, etc.) lower on the beach in something like strata,
and in that way evidence is being perverted. Some day a new bank
or even a dune may be formed over these secondary deposits and a
great source of possible future error be completed.</p>

<p>All the natives along the river (to here) like to bury on the lower
slopes of near-by hills.</p>

<p>To bed on floor of kitchen tent at the fine, clean little place of
Tucker's, at 10.30. At 1.30 the 20 dogs start a fine, sustained, unison
howl song, and I seem to hear an approaching boat. As the Governor
of Alaska is expected, slip on shoes and necktie, brush hair,
and run out. There is a little boat at the little "dock" (the only
one seen so far on the Yukon). Tucker and his son are already
there, and I soon hear that the governor is on the boat, which is
that of Mr. Townsend, of the Fish Commission. In a few minutes
we meet, both in shirt sleeves. And I learn the <em>Matanuska</em>, the
boat that was to take me from the Russian Mission to St. Michael,
has broken down and is not coming. In her place, but no telling
as to time, will be sent the <em>Agnes</em>, a smaller and slower boat, on
which three people have already this season been "gassed" (overcome
by the exhaust gases), one of them jumping into the river.
She has accommodation for four persons at most, and that of the
most primitive, they say. The governor fortunately gives me some
hope that I may be picked up and taken down by the same boat which
is taking him to Holy Cross. He also tells me of a skull for me at
one of the stopping places, Old Hamilton. A frank, good, strong
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Boat leaves in a few minutes. Back to bed, but now almost full
daylight&mdash;also cold, and so no more than a doze until 6.15, at which
time the boy comes to the kitchen where I was kindly accommodated
to start fire and breakfast. So up with a drowsy head. At 7 breakfast&mdash;coffee,
oatmeal, flapjacks, and good company. Everything
about this place is neat, fresh, pleasing&mdash;the best individual place
on the river. Cloudy, blustery, cool; can not start, so go 1½ miles
down to Dogfish village, or I-ka-thloy-gia-miut&mdash;probably the same
as Zagoskin's I-ka-lig-vig-miut. Only three or four families there
now; nearly all the inhabitants died of influenza in 1900. But
already before reaching the village, in examining the stones along
the beach, I find some chipped ones, and they represent the same
industry evidently as those at the two sites yesterday. Later find
numerous chipped scrapers, pointed hammers, crude cutters and
chisels, and a few axes. Make quite a collection, including a few
objects found in possession of natives.</p>

<p>This is a good site, above high water. Must be old. Pottery also
encountered occasionally by present occupants, but not one bead;
little if any river cutting here for a long period. Worth exploration.
Photograph another Indianlike Eskimo. Want to buy an old dish
from an Eskimo, border inlaid with six white stones, shaped like an
oblong lozenge with rounded corners, but he wants $20. Lunch all
together, some Eskimo included, at Tucker's, and then as the wind
moderates and the sun comes out, start for the Russian Mission.
Mostly still clouds and cool, with some rain in the mountains to
the right.</p>

<p>Finds and inquiries made at Dogfish village make it positive that
the stone culture there is Eskimo, i. e., of the Eskimo of this region
who are probably not a little mixed with Indians. Their head is
but moderately oblong, not keel shaped. The majority, however,
have Eskimo features.</p>

<p>But the cupid-bow (double-grooved) axes are not known to have
been made by these people, and when used after being found or
brought down from farther up the river they apparently were
broken. One such example was seen already at Ruby&mdash;another one
at Anvik&mdash;secured; and one found yesterday at Mountain village.
The axes here are most often oblong, quadrilateral, without groove,
or approaching the single-grooved axes of the Indians in the States.</p>

<p>July 6. Proceed down the river toward Russian Mission, examining
the banks as closely as possible. Toward evening stop at
"Gurtler's," a short distance above the mission.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurtler is a German by birth; his wife is half Indian, of Ruby.
She, as well as her 14-year-old daughter, are neat, apt, and very industrious,
quiet and nice mannered. With an Eskimo woman, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
cleans and cuts up&mdash;a whole art of its own&mdash;on the average over 200
good-sized salmon a day. Clean place, very good smoking house&mdash;much
superior to those up the river, except Tucker's.</p>

<p>Sleep in a clean bed of theirs; would much prefer my own and
the hard floor, but fear to offend.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Russian Mission</span></h3>

<p>Pack my stones and bones collected between here and Holy Cross,
and after lunch go to Russian Mission. Meet Mr. Cris Betsch, the
trader, and find him both friendly and anxious to help. Teacher
and her mother invite me to supper. Before that Mr. Betsch calls in
a number of the older men, and we have a talk about ancient things,
but they know nothing worth while beyond a few score of years at
most; they give me, however, some data and names of old villages.</p>

<p>A few years ago some human bones and skulls were dug up here
and reburied. Eskimo readily agree to help us find them and to let
me take them. Moreover, they are quite eager to dig up an old medicine
man supposed to be buried under a good-sized (for this country)
blue spruce. They get shovels, soon find some of the old bones and a
damaged skull, and later on, with the help of information given by
an elderly woman, uncover also a female skull. Uncover further
the end of two birch-bark-covered coffins, from Russian time, and
would readily dig them out did I not restrain them; as also with
the medicine man. We shall probably get some such specimens from
this locality later, so there is no need of disturbing the burials.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrick, the teacher, gives us a "civilized" supper, at which I
am introduced for the first time to a great and fine Yukon specialty,
namely, smoked raw strips of king salmon, and find them excellent.
Then a good talk with all, after which pack specimens&mdash;still somewhat
damp, but it would be difficult to wait&mdash;deliver to the post, and
am sent to my place around the hill at a little past 10 p. m. with an
invitation by Mr. Betsch to go to-morrow to "the slough of the 32
kashims (council or communal house)," about 10 miles down the
river. But I have already been promised by Gurtler to take me
down to this place, and so I can not accept. Just now I need sleep.</p>

<p>July 7. After breakfast examine banks and beach along Gurtler's
place and find two stone implements, two pieces of decorated pottery,
and a bone of some animal. Wash, dry, and pack, then a cup
of coffee&mdash;the Gurtler's have a habit of drinking a second cup at
about 10 a. m. each day&mdash;and then, after some of the seemingly
inevitable trouble with motor, start down the river. It rained yesterday;
the clouds show low pressure; it is not warm and the water
is somewhat rough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Stop a bit at the mission to give Mrs. Barrick a fish and get a bag
or two from Mr. Betsch, and then proceed. From the river the
Russian Mission settlement is seen to be very favorably situated at
the foot of the southern slope of a big hill. But the recency of the
flat below and in front of the church and schoolhouse is clearly
seen again. The site about where the church and school are may&mdash;in
fact must, it is so favored&mdash;be a very old one, and doubtless a
thorough excavation of the slope from the back of the houses
upward would be both easy and very instructive. The place should
by all means receive attention.</p>

<p>Reach and examine the "32 kashim slough," a beautiful side channel
about 7 miles long; reach about 1½ miles from its entrance,
examine banks and pass through jungle, find tracks of foxes and of
a bear, also see one big beautiful red fox trotting ahead of us on the
other beach&mdash;but not a trace of man. Examine also the "mounds"
on Grand Island, but find them to be only dunes.</p>

<p>Lunch on the beach; remarkably few mosquitoes and no gnats;
smoked raw salmon strips again, and coffee; and at 5 leave for home,
it being impossible so late to go down to the end of the channel.</p>

<p>On return all going nicely until 5. Then, in a slough 3½ miles
from the Russian Mission, after an examination of another likely site,
breakdown of the motor. Do everything possible to make it go until
about 8, but in vain. Then I take the crazy little rowboat that luckily
we took with us, bail out the water with our shovel, and row to
the mission for help. Get there about 9, send back a launch with some
natives, have a little supper with the teacher, and row home around
the hill, reaching Gurtler's near 11. In a few minutes the launch
is towed in and all is well once more. Mr. Betsch got for us two
good native "kantágs" or wooden dishes. Also we fix to go down to
the "32 kashims" to-morrow once more with Mr. Betsch and the
teacher.</p>

<p>July 8. Up a little after 6; breakfast; and then comes in a native
from the mission with two letters and information that the <em>Agnes</em>,
the little mail-carrier boat, has arrived during the night and is waiting
for me to take me to Marshall and to Old Hamilton, whence
another boat will take me in a day or two to St. Michael. So get
ready in a minute, put my baggage on a native's boat, pay my bill,
leave another lot of good friends, and row to the mission. There is
the little dinghy <em>Agnes</em> with its "accommodation" for three passengers
already two-thirds filled up, and towing two big logs as a freight.
Put my things partly in a "bunk," partly on the roof, give good-byes
to Betsch and the teacher, help to push off the boat which is stuck in
the mud, and we are off for another Yukon chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>We pass by the lower end of the "32 kashim" slough&mdash;no sign of
any site&mdash;all recently made flats. If there is anything left of the old
sites it must be at the foot of the hills, or has been covered with silt.
The site is so favorable that in all probability there was once there
a good-sized settlement, but due to river action and the jungle it
could not be located. Mr. Betsch visited the place that day, and again
with some old natives on another occasion, without being more
fortunate.</p>

<p>Cloudy, slightly drizzly day, no trace of sun, mists over the tops of
the hills. Could not stand it in the boat, so sitting on my box on
the roof of the boat, wrapped, due to the cold, in a blanket.</p>

<p>A little below the "32 kashim" slough a small stream enters from
inland&mdash;a place to be examined; but this boat can not stop for such
a purpose.</p>

<p>A half mile or so farther down a few graves and crosses, with
remnants of a native habitation.</p>

<p>Over 3 miles down, just beyond first bluff, fine site, with low hills
stretching far beyond it&mdash;now but a few empty, half-ruined native
houses. Should be explored.</p>

<p>South of second rocky bluff a live camp, and farther down another.</p>

<p>The left side of the river is still all flats as far as one can see,
but about 17 miles below Russian Mission human bones came out of
a bank there (on a slough).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marshall</span></h3>

<p>At 3 p. m. reach Marshall, a little cheerful-looking mining town,
high on a bank. See the place, identify the skeleton from the above-mentioned
bank as that of a missing white man, see telegraph operator,
postmaster, teacher, commissioner. Sun comes out, is warm.
Almost no mosquitoes here and no gnats. Hills above and beyond
town belong already to the coast range and are barren of trees, even
largely bare of shrubs and bushes. Leave 4.30.</p>

<p>Soon after Marshall&mdash;after passing by an Eskimo village (white
man's style of buildings)&mdash;leave the hills and enter flats on both
sides. This is the beginning of the delta region. River like glass,
and it is warm in the sun but very perceptibly cooler when sun is
hidden.</p>

<p>The boat has only three bunks, and there are five of us with the two
pilots. But on the last trip up, there were, fortunately only for
about eight hours, seven, including two women and a child, and that
without any privacy or conveniences whatsoever. It is almost criminal,
and they charge a very steep fare. However, for me it will
soon be over&mdash;only about 36 hours. Still it is hard to believe this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
is yet in the United States and presumably under some sort of
supervision.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a realization that the first half of my journey&mdash;the
preliminary survey of the Yukon&mdash;is slowly closing; a
little, and it will be the sea and other conditions, which also brings
the realization that I have seen much but learned not greatly. What
should be done would be to own a suitable fast boat; to locate on each
of the more important old sites a party for careful, prolonged excavation;
and to try to locate, in the rear of or on the higher places on
the present river flats, more ancient sites than are known to date.
These steps, together with the enlisting of the interest in these matters
of every prospector, miner, and trader, would before many years
lead to much substantial knowledge.</p>

<p>Friday, July 9. Must keep up these notes, for they alone keep me
posted on the day and date; even then I am not always sure. There
are no Sundays in nature.</p>

<p>Slept in my bag on the roof of the <em>Agnes</em>. Her namesake must
have been one of these goodly but insufficient and but indifferently
clean native women, plodding, doing not a little work, but wanting
in many a thing. It was cold and dreary, but I found an additional
blanket, and so, with mosquito netting about my head&mdash;one or two
got in anyway&mdash;would have slept quite well had it not been for a
dog. At about 1 a. m. we stopped in front of a little place called
also "Mountain Village." And almost at once we began to hear a
most piteous and insistent wail of a dog who either had colic or thirst
or hunger, and he kept it up with but little stops for what seemed
like two hours, making my sleep, at least, impossible.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 9. Morning. Cold, cloudy, rough&mdash;head almost
beginning to feel uncomfortable, the boat is tossing so much. A
teacher comes aboard with an inflamed hand which I fix; a few
questions, the mail bag, and we are off again. Enter a slough where
it is less rough and warmer. Later the sun will probably come out
again. This evening we shall be at Old Hamilton and then a new
anxiety&mdash;how to get to St. Michael.</p>

<p>Just had a little walk over the roof&mdash;my roof, for the other two
passengers prefer to sleep in the gassy, dingy room below, though how
they can stand it is beyond my medical ken. It is four short steps
long, or five half steps in an oblique direction.</p>

<p>Every object in distance appears magnified all along the river for
many days now. An old snag will look like a boat or a man, hills
look higher, a boat looks much more pretentious than she proves to
be on meeting.</p>

<p>Firs and spruce have now completely disappeared, also forests of
birch, etc., are reduced to brush both on flats and lower parts of hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Very large portion of the hills in distance just greenish with grass
and lichens, not even a brush.</p>

<p>9.45 a. m. Meet the <em>Matanuska</em> bound upward. Looked from distance
like an ocean steamer; from near, just a lumbering, moderate-sized
river boat with a barge in front. But a whole lot better than
ours.</p>

<p>The scenery has become monotonous. The gray river, although
only one of the "mouths," is broad, and the country is all low.
Nothing but bushy or grassy cut banks on the right, and mud flats,
"smoking" under the wind, to low banks on left. It is a little
warmer and the warm sun shows itself occasionally, but I still need
the wrapping of a double blanket. The wind luckily is with us and
the waves not too bad.</p>

<p>Noon. Passing "Fish village"; a few huts and tents.</p>

<p>No "camps" here outside the few villages; just an endless dreary
waste and water.</p>

<p>New Hamilton&mdash;a few native huts only now&mdash;no whites.</p>

<p>Reach Old Hamilton&mdash;about a dozen houses with a warehouse,
a store of the Northern Commercial Co., and a nice looking but now
unoccupied school.</p>

<p>Here the governor told me there was somewhere a skull waiting
for me, and the storekeeper would tell me of it. But when we arrive
there are only two or three natives to meet us. The storekeeper,
who is also postmaster, is said to be sick in bed. He is supposed to
have an ulcer or some other bad thing of the stomach. So we go to
his house and find him in bed, with a lot of medicine bottles on a table
next to him. Is alone; no wife. Shows no enthusiasm in seeing me,
though heard of my coming. Reads letters&mdash;no attention to me.
Gets up&mdash;I ask him about his illness&mdash;answers like a man carrying a
chip on his shoulder. Goes to store to attend to mail, and barely
asks me to follow. I wait in store; he finishes mail and goes out&mdash;orders
the Eskimo present out gruffly, and to me says, "You may
stay in the store; I'll be back." But I wait and wait, and finally
decide the man for some reason is unwilling to help me. Asked him
before he went out about the <em>Matanuska</em>, but he told me she might
not be back from Holy Cross in a month, trying doubtless to discourage
me to stay. On going toward the <em>Agnes</em> I find him sitting
on a log and talking to a couple of men from a tugboat that has
arrived&mdash;just talk, no business, judging from their laughing. So I
go on the boat, write a few words to Mr. Townsend of the Bureau of
Fisheries, who makes this place his headquarters, and with some
feeling hand this to the man, telling him at the same time that
plainly he does not wish to assist me in any way. This, of course,
rouses him; he gets red and says a few lame words, ending with,
"Do you think I would touch any of them dam things or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
I would let any of my men (natives) touch them? Not on your
life!" So I leave Old Hamilton, for he is the only white man there
now. But the place had other distinctions. Until recently, I am
told, they have had a teacher, a young girl, who in her zeal had the
natives collect all the burial boxes with their contents and had them
all thrown into the river. Not long after she accomplished that she
left. The storekeeper told me that "If I want them so bad I could
pick them up (skulls and bones) along the river where the water
washed them out after the teacher threw them in." Luckily there
were not many "Old Hamiltons."</p>

<p>We met here a boat from St. Michael with Mr. Frank P. Williams,
the well-known postmaster and trader of St. Michael, who comes
for the two men, my fellow passengers. We get acquainted and, to
escape the gases of the <em>Agnes</em>, I go with them. The boat is heavier
and free from fumes, though without accommodation. At about 7
p. m. we arrive at Kotlik, at the mouth of the river&mdash;an abandoned
wireless station, a store, and four tents of natives. But the old
wireless building, now the storekeeper's house, is the dwelling place
of a clean white man, Mr. Backlund, who is now "outside," but
with whom Mr. Williams is in some partnership; so we occupy the
building. Outside the wind has risen to half a gale and there are
squalls of rain and drizzle. The <em>Agnes</em> has to "tie to," as she would
be swamped in the open. My boxes and bedding, which were on the
roof of the <em>Agnes</em>, are soaked, though the contents will be dry. So
both boats are fastened to a little "dock," and we soon have fire in
the stove, supper, and then&mdash;it is 11 p. m.&mdash;a bed, not overclean,
somewhat smelly, but a bed and free from mosquitoes, rain, wind,
and cold.</p>

<p>July 10. Up at 6.30. Outside a storm and rain&mdash;just like one of
the three-day northeasters with us, and cool. Both boats were to
leave, but are unable to do so. I find that Mr. Williams's tug will
come back here and go to St. Michael on the 13th, so arrange with
Mr. Williams to take me and leave the <em>Agnes</em> for good. This partly
because I learn of two graveyards near, one 1½, the other 4½
miles distant.</p>

<p>After lunch, rain for a while ceasing, I set out for the nearer
burial place. This is already a tundra country&mdash;treeless and bush-less
flats overgrown with a thick coat of moss, into which feet bury
themselves as in a cushion, and dotted with innumerable swampy
depressions with high swamp grass. Walking over all this is very
difficult&mdash;lucky I have rubber boots. Even so, it is no easy matter,
except where a little native trail is encountered.</p>

<p>The graveyard, belonging to the now abandoned little village above
Kotlik, consists of only about half a dozen adult graves. These
consist of boxes of heavy lumber laid on a base raised above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
ground level, and covered with other heavy boards. Some of the
burials are quite recent. Open three older ones. In two the remains
are too fresh yet, but from one secure a good female skeleton,
which I pack in a practically new heavy pail, thrown out probably
on the occasion of the last funeral. Then back, farther out, to avoid
notice, through swamps and over moss, and with a recurring wind-driven
drizzle against which my umbrella is but a weak protection.</p>

<p>Reach home quite wet and a bit tired. Have to undress and,
wrapped in a blanket, dry my clothes and underwear about the
stove.</p>

<p>Nothing further this day and evening&mdash;just wind and heavy low
clouds and rain.</p>

<p>July 11. Up at 4.40. Weather has moderated. The <em>Agnes</em> left
at 4 and Mr. Williams's boat, due to favorable tide, must soon go
also. Breakfast, and all leave me before 6.</p>

<p>Yesterday we brought up my needs&mdash;i. e., collection of skeletal
material&mdash;to the few natives here, explaining to them everything,
and they do not object in the least. One of them, in fact, is to take
me to-day to the more distant cemetery in a rowboat and help me
in my work.</p>

<p>My man, after being sent for, comes at a little after 7. He is a
good-looking and well-behaving Eskimo of about 35. He brings a
good-sized tin rowboat&mdash;a whaling or navy boat probably; but "he
leaks a whole lot." The oarlocks are not fastened to the boat, the
plate of one is loose, and the oars are crudely homemade of driftwood
and pieces of lumber fastened on with nails; in one the shaft
is crooked, while the other is much heavier. But we start, with the
sky still leaden and gray but no wind and calm water. I row
and he paddles; then he rows and I paddle. We carry but the
camera, a little lunch, a heavier coat each, and a box and two bags
for the specimens. We pass a number of broods of little ducks, the
mother prancing before us until the young are in safety, and there
are several species of new kinds (to me) of water birds, some of
which fly right above us, examining us. In the distance we see a
big abandoned dredge, then a few empty log houses and "barabras"
on the bank of a stream and the edge of the tundra. This is Pastolik,
our destination. There is no one anywhere near, an ideal condition
for work, if work there'll be. And there will be&mdash;for almost
immediately upon landing I see, beginning at a few rods distance
on the tundra, a series (about 50) of old graves, in all grades of
mossiness and preservation. A few are, we later find, quite late, but
the majority are old&mdash;60 years and over according to information
given by the natives of Kotlik. They do not, except perhaps the
few late ones, seem to belong to anyone still living. Yet "Pash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>tolik,"
as they wrote it then, used to be a place of some importance
in the Russian times, and even later.</p>

<p>We settle in an empty native house, and I start investigation.
The older graves are found widely spread in several clusters, but a
few are isolated at a distance.</p>

<p>The graves are all aboveground and resemble in substance those
along the lower Yukon (Bonasila and downward). They consist
of a base of small logs or splits; a rude box about 3 feet long by
about 2 feet wide, of heavy, unpainted, unnailed, split boards; four
posts near the four corners; a cover, unjoined, of two to three heavy
split boards; two crosspieces over this, at head and base, perforated
and sliding over the upright posts, and a few half splits (smaller
drift logs split in two) laid over the top of the crosspieces.</p>

<p>On the first cover lies as a rule a stone&mdash;generally a piece of a
slab or a good-sized pebble&mdash;unworked, though now and then showing
some trace of use. The pebble is generally broken.</p>

<p>When the grave is opened there is usually over the body, as a
canopy on a light frame, a large (probably caribou) skin&mdash;rarely
birch bark. Neither covers or envelops the body but simply forms
a covering over it, with some space between it and the body. The
body lies flexed, on left or (rarely) right side, with the head toward
(or near) the east (same as at Bonasila). It is often covered with
or enveloped in a native matting. There are but few traces of
clothing on women; none on men. And very seldom is there anything
else in the coffin.</p>

<p>Some of the oldest graves were found tumbled down and could
not be examined. The moss and roots envelop the bones, and it is a
tough job to get them out; also they eat the bones and destroy them.
Even in the older boxes, however, the downward part of the skeleton&mdash;generally
the left&mdash;is, due to moisture, usually in much worse
state of preservation than the upper.</p>

<p>Children have been buried in large native wooden dishes and
these were in some cases placed on the top of adult graves, but more
generally about these, or even apart.</p>

<p>Many household articles, from matches and pails to dishes, alarm
clocks, lamps, etc., are placed upon the ground near the more recent
dead. Excavation would probably recover here many older objects,
though wood decays.</p>

<p>The wind has died down and the flat is as full of mosquitoes as a
Jersey salt meadow, and there is an occasional gnat. They bite, and,
having been almost free of the pest at Kotlik, I failed to take my
"juice" along, so just have to do the best possible. The gnats enter
even the eyes, however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Work as never before. Decide to utilize the rare opportunity to
the limit, and to take the whole skeletons, not merely the skulls, leaving
only the few fresher ones and those that are badly damaged. A
great Sunday; burial after burial; opening the wooden grave&mdash;taking
out and marking on the spot bone after bone&mdash;fighting mosquitoes
all the while&mdash;and packing temporarily in any convenient
receptacle. Fortunately there are quite a few boxes and pails and
oil cans on the spot, left by the dredge people and the few natives
who evidently sometimes come to the place. At about 2 eat lunch&mdash;coffee
(the Eskimo put what was for three cups into about two
quarts of water, so there is but a suggestion of coffee), raw smoked
fish for me and eggs with bacon (left over from breakfast) for my
companion, and on again until about 5 p. m. or a little later. Last
two or three hours, however, work with some difficulty. A gnat bit
me in an eyelid, or got into my eye, and that has now swollen so
that I can hardly see with it. My Eskimo, however, is about all I
could wish. He just looks at me working in a matter-of-fact way,
and carries the filled boxes, or looks around for something I could
take with me, and even helps on a few occasions with the bones, finding
evidently the whole proceeding quite right and natural. Brings
me, among other things, an old copper teakettle, but to his wonder I
do not want it and leave it. I find a fine large walrus-ivory doll
and a handsome decorated "kantág" (wooden bowl), besides smaller
objects, and also a large piece of a poor quality clay pot (no pottery
now), with a fragment of a decorated border as on the lower Yukon.</p>

<p>Pack up, we load on the boat&mdash;lucky now she is so spacious&mdash;get
into the shallow river&mdash;the tide has run out&mdash;push the boat out and
start for home.</p>

<p>Thus far we had but slight drizzles. But the clouds now grow
heavier, and as we have much farther to row than this morning,
due to the low water, we are caught by showers. The last mile or so
we have to hurry, see a big rain approaching. My man pushes her
with a pole while I row all I can, with both hands, with the heavy
oar. Of course the whole population of Kotlik has to see our arrival.
And more, too, for in our absence a schooner came in with wood and
a number of the natives. They talk, but no one is either angry or
excited. We two carry the boxes, pails, etc.&mdash;grass covered&mdash;into the
house; how lucky I am now alone. Inside I remove the wet grass
from them&mdash;the bones, too, are somewhat wet&mdash;then pay my Eskimo
$5, which again is taken as a matter-of-fact thing, without thanks,
but he well deserved the amount, even if I rowed a full half.</p>

<p>It is 9 p. m. My man comes again, we have a modest supper, he
some left-over meat and I again the smoked fish, which I feel is
strengthening me as well as agreeing with my stomach, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
rest, quite earned to-day. Seldom have done as much in a day.
Thirty-three graves collected, with over twenty nearly complete skeletons,
and all restored so that I had to take considerable care not to go
again into some already emptied. But this place should be dug
over. The tundra in a few years swallows up everything on the
surface. It literally buries or assimilates bones and all other objects,
the moss and other vegetation with probably blown dust covering
them very effectively. Finding anything below the surface and that
even a foot or more, as was actually experienced, means something
quite different under these conditions than it might elsewhere.</p>

<p>Monday, July 12. Slept fairly well and feel refreshed, but the
eye still badly swollen. The Eskimo believe, I think, I got it from
the bones. Yet they are quite sensible&mdash;a marked mental difference
between them and the Yukon Indians.</p>

<p>Breakfast before 7&mdash;cereal, raw smoked fish, and coffee. Then
pack. At the store buy empty gasoline boxes, but no nails to be had,
and no packing. Lunch at 1&mdash;macaroni, raw smoked fish, sauerkraut,
coffee; then pack again, fix boxes, break old ones to get nails,
even pull a few unnecessary ones from the boards of the house, go
see my man's wife, a hopeless consumptive, and at 6 through with all
except cleaning. Another fair work-day, 12 tightly packed boxes.
Then clean up, burn rubbish, and ready for departure early to-morrow.</p>

<p>Supper&mdash;macaroni, raw smoked fish, greengage plums, a little
sauerkraut, and coffee. Then a little walk outside, watch Eskimo
women and children jump the rope (hilariously, but awkwardly),
and go in to catch up with my notes. Nobody scowls at me, so that
although they probably fear me as a "medicine man" they are not
at all resentful for what I did yesterday. They are grown-up children,
much more tractable than the Indians. But otherwise they
show so much in common with the Indian that the more one sees of
them the more he grows drawn to the belief of the original (and that
not so far distant) identity of their parentage. It seems the Eskimo
and the Indian are after all no more than two diverging fingers
of one and the same hand; or they were so a bit farther back.
Mental differences there are, yet these are no more than may be found
in different tribes of the Indians or different groups of other races.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 13. Rise a little after 6. Eye still sore after
Sunday's gnat and sweat and dirt; must use boric acid frequently.
An Eskimo actually said yesterday it was a sickness from touching
the bones. A little breakfast&mdash;have no more salmon strips, so just
cereal, canned plums, and coffee. And then with the help of two
young Eskimo carry my spoils and baggage on to the tug, which has
come for me. By about 7 start. Good-by Kotlik, what little there
is of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>At 9 arrive at Mr. Williams's reindeer camp farther up the coast.
There are five tents and two small log houses of natives&mdash;the herders
with their families, dogs, and fish racks; and three whites, Mr.
Williams, owner of the boat and of most of the herd of about
8,000 animals; Mr. Palmer, of the United States Biological Survey;
and a Dane, Mr. Posielt, here for the Biological Survey of Canada.
All are already at the corral some distance over the hill, branding,
counting, etc., the great reindeer herd, which belong to several
owners.</p>

<p>A short walk along the shore brings me in sight of the herd.
The animals can be heard grunting a good distance off. The herd
is so large and so compact that it looks like a forest of horns. The
animals keep on moving in streams, but remain in the herd. They
go to the shore to drink some of the salty water, instead of salt.
All is of interest, even though the branding, the cutting off of big
slices from the ears, and castration, is rather cruel.</p>

<p>At lunch, for the first time, reindeer meat, a select steak. It is
tender and decidedly good. Has no special flavor and is poor in
fat, but tender and good.</p>

<p>Afternoon, once more to the corral, and then various things,
including a photograph of a little impromptu native group.</p>

<p>Supper once more on reindeer meat. This time prepared as a
sort of a stew with onions&mdash;again very good. But we were to leave
after supper for St. Michael and I see no intention to that effect.
Instead they all go once more to the corral to continue the work
until about 11 p. m. So I have to settle for the night, with some
hope that we may leave in the morning. We sleep four side by
side in a tent 10 feet wide. Luckily they had a spare clean blanket
or two, and but one of the three snores, and he like a lady; also
the weather has cleared and is warmer, so the night is fairly good.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 14. Morning bright, calm. Breakfast, and all
hurry off to corral without even any explanation&mdash;just a few casual
words, from which I understand that we shall not go. So I write
whole forenoon, though feeling none too good about the delay.
Had I my own boat, as one should have in this country, all would be
different. As it is I am utterly helpless. At lunch speak to Mr.
Williams; and though not much willing, he half promises that we
may go to St. Michael to-night.</p>

<p>Afternoon. Walk 8 miles along the beach, to a cape and back,
looking in vain for traces of human habitation and collecting along
the beach what this offers, which outside of some odd, flat, polished
stones is but little. Come back near 6&mdash;soon after supper&mdash;and hear
with much satisfaction that, after all, we will go to-night to St.
Michael.</p>

<p class="center">RÉSUMÉ</p>

<p>So ends the Yukon and its immediate vicinity. What has been
learned?</p>

<p>1. The great and easily navigable river, extending for many hundreds
of miles from west to east, could not but have played a material
part in the peopling of Alaska, and quite probably in that
of the continent, and all human movements along it must have left
some material remains. It seems, therefore, a justified inference that
the valley of the Yukon harbors human remains of much scientific
value.</p>

<p>2. Such remains, judging from the present conditions, were left
exclusively along the banks of the river, on the flood-safe elevated
platforms of the banks, and especially about the mouths of the
tributaries of the Yukon of those times.</p>

<p>3. But the banks and mouths of the past are seldom, if ever, those
of to-day. The river, with its currents, storms, and ice pack every
spring, is changing from year to year. It is ever cutting and eroding
in places, and building bars and islands or covering with flood silts
in others. In many stretches no one can be sure where the banks
were 500 or 1,000 years ago, not to speak of earlier periods.</p>

<p>4. The banks and islands of to-day, therefore, are for the most
part recent formations, in which it would be useless to expect anything
very ancient. And there is nothing like the successive ocean
beaches at Nome and elsewhere, which would guide exploration.</p>

<p>5. The right hilly side of the river alone seems to offer some hope
of locating some more ancient sites and remains; yet it is quite
certain that the river ran once far to the left, for all the vast flats
on that side are of its construction; so that the more ancient remains
of man may lie in that direction. But there everything is,
from the point of view of archeology, a practically unexplorable
jungle and wilderness, and there is no one there who might make
accidental discoveries.</p>

<p>6. It would seem that the best hope for the archeologist along the
Yukon, so far as the more ancient remains are concerned, lies along
the tributaries of the stream, and that particularly at the old limits
of the more recently made lands.</p>

<p>7. Nevertheless the banks of the Yukon as they are now are not
wholly barren. Up from Tanana, at the Old Station, probably about
Ruby and Nulato, about Kaltag and the Greyling River, at Bonasila,
Holy Cross and Ghost Creek, and at the Mountain village, Dog
village, Russian Mission, and doubtless a number of other sites, they
contain both cultural and skeletal remains that, if recovered, will be
invaluable to the anthropological history of these regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>8. The line of demarcation between the Indians of the Yukon and
the Eskimo, outside of language, is indefinite. Traces of old Eskimo
admixture are perceptible among the Indians far up the river, and
the cultures of the two peoples in many respects merge into each
other; while among the Eskimo of the lower river and farther on
there are physiognomies that it would be hard to separate from the
Indian. Whether all this means simply extensive past mixture, or
whether, as would seem, the Alaska Indians as a whole are nearer
physically to the Eskimo than are the tribes in the States, remains
to be determined. Among the Athapascan Mescalero Apache, who
have reached as far south as New Mexico, a somewhat Eskimoid
tinge to the face, especially in young women, was by no means very
unusual 25 years ago when I studied this tribe. This problem will
be touched upon again in this volume.</p>

<p>9. All along the Yukon, from near Tanana (Old Station) to the
mouth of the river, in the Indian and in the Eskimo region, there prevailed
the same type of winter house, namely, a largely subterranean
room with a subterranean tunnel or corridor entrance; and also a
similar type of summer dwelling, formerly a skin, now a canvas, tent.
The winter dwellings were built within of stout posts and covered
with birch bark and sod, looking from outside much like the present-day
Navaho hogan; while the pits left by them remind one of the
southwestern "pit dwellings," the kashims of the Pueblo kivas. As
a hogan, so these largely subterranean dwellings along the Yukon
had a smoke-air-and-light hole in the center of the top, a fireplace
in the middle of the floor, and benches (of heavy hewn planks in the
north) along the sides. Each village, furthermore, had at least one
larger structure of similar nature, the "kashim," or communal house.
All this may still be traced more or less plainly on the dead sites
along the Yukon, and houses as well as a kashim of this type were
seen at Kotlik and Pastolik, at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>10. The native industry of the river presents also much similarity,
though there are differences.</p>

<p>Pottery, of much the same type and decoration, was made at
least as far as the lower middle Yukon.</p>

<p>Stone implements were made and used all along the river, and
were much alike. But the double-grooved, cupid-bow ax of the
Yukon Indian, hafted in the center and used for chipping rather
than cutting, is lower down replaced by the same ax, in which one
end has been broken off (or has not been finished), and which is
hafted as an adze; or by oblong quadrilateral flat axes which have
not been found up the river.</p>

<p>The peculiar and apparently very primitive stone industry of
Bonasila is, it seems, just a development of local conditions&mdash;nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of most available stone, and essentially hunting habit of the people
that resulted in many skins which called for numerous scrapers.
Nevertheless the site deserves a thorough further exploration.</p>

<p>There was apparently not much basketry along the river, the place
of the baskets being taken by the birch-bark dishes of the Indian and
the kantág or ingeniously made wooden dish of the Eskimo part of
the river.</p>

<p>Canoes among the Yukon Indians were mainly of birch bark,
while the Eskimo had mainly skin canoes.</p>

<p>11. Neither the Indians nor the Eskimo of the Yukon practiced
deformation of the head or of any other part of the body, or dental
mutilation. The Indians as well as the Eskimo occasionally pierced
the septum of the nose, for nose pieces, while the Eskimo cut on
each side a slit in the lower lip for the introduction of labrets. The
Eskimo cut their hair short in a characteristic way, reminding
strongly of certain monks; the Indians left their hair long. But
at Anvik the Indians both cut their hair and wore labrets. They
also used the wooden dish.</p>

<p>12. From all the preceding it appears that there must have been
long and intensive contacts between the Yukon Eskimo and Indians;
that, through war or in peace, they became mutually admixed; and
that there were mutual cultural transmissions.</p>

<p>13. No further light for the present could be gained on the origin,
antiquity, or early migrations of the Yukon Indian. It was determined,
however, that he represents but one main physical type, and
that this type is the same as that of the Indians of the Tanana and
most other Alaskan Indians of the present time.</p>

<p>14. Exceptional skeletal remains were washed out from the bank
at Bonasila. They are of Indians (?), but appear to be not those
of the Yukon Indian of to-day. They present a problem which is
to be solved by further exploration of the site.</p>

<p>15. The Eskimo of the lower parts of the river are in general
better preserved and more coherent than the Indians. They are
more tractable people and are taking more readily to work and
civilization.</p>

<p>16. These Eskimo show, in the majority of cases, fairly typical
Eskimo physiognomies. But their heads are not as those of the
northern and eastern members of the race. The head is less narrow,
less high, and has but now and then a suggestion of the scaphoid
form that is so characteristic of the Greenland, Labrador, or northern
Eskimo cranium; also, the angles of the jaws are less bulging
and the lower jaws themselves do not appear so heavy.</p>

<p>17. The Yukon Eskimo burials are in all essentials much like
those of the Indians up the river. Here again a cultural connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
is very evident, in this case there having in all probability been an
adaptation of methods by the Eskimo from the Indians.</p>

<p>18. Archeological prospects along the delta flats occupied by the
Eskimo appear very limited.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">St. Michael</span></h3>

<p>Thursday, July 15. In the morning, after a good trip, reach St.
Michael&mdash;quite a town from a distance, with many boats on the
shore in front of it; but soon find that it is largely a dead city and
ships' graveyard, not harbor. With the gold rush over, and the Government
railroad from Seward to the Tanana, men and business
have departed. Before the summer is over most of the large buildings
and the fine large boats are to be demolished, and there will
be left but a lonely village.</p>

<p>Unload my collections on the old dock. The postman kindly comes
down from his place, which, with Mr. Williams's store, is far up on
the hill above the harbor, the boxes are weighed and stamped for
the parcel post, and relieved of them I go to the hotel and spend the
day in visiting the teacher, the marshal, Mr. Williams's store, where
I see a whole lot of recent Eskimo ceremonial masks decorated with
colors and feathers, and the wireless station to send a message to the
Institution. All native (Eskimo) character is almost gone from the
place, what remains being mainly civilized mix bloods; and also
little, if anything, remains to be collected, particularly now when all
vacant land is thickly overgrown with grass and weeds. An occasional
skull appears, one having been seen recently on the beach and
one on Whale Island, but there is little besides, though things could
be found doubtless by excavation.</p>

<p>Items of interest in Mr. Williams's store, and also in that of the
N. C. Co., are various articles cut handsomely by the Eskimo
from walrus ivory, both fresh and "fossil" (old and nicely discolored).
There are beads, napkin rings, hairpins, cigar and cigarette
holders, and other objects, generally exceedingly well made and
decorated. It is, of course, well known that the Eskimo are very apt
in this work; it is not, however, so well known that every island
or village has certain specialties and types of decoration. This is
so true that an observer before long can tell in many instances just
where a given article has been made.</p>

<p>The fossil ivory industry is, it was soon learned, becoming a
serious detriment to archeological work in these regions; of which,
however, more later.</p>

<p>During the day I find that a small boat, the <em>Silver Wave</em>, belonging
to Lomen Bros., will leave St. Michael for Nome that same evening.
As this suits me very well I engage a berth on the boat, help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to get my baggage on deck over a broken landing place, and get
ready to depart.</p>

<p>At 6 leave St. Michael. The <em>Silver Wave</em> is a tub&mdash;too short&mdash;am
told if it were of proper length they would have to have more help.
Result&mdash;very unsteady. Fortunately the weather is fair, and the
captain gives me a berth in his cabin. I had originally a stateroom,
right in the back, with three bunks or beds, so small that one could
barely get into the beds; but there came two mix-breed women with
a girl and so they turned me out and put me in the "hole"&mdash;seven
bunks in an ill-ventilated cabin under the deck in the stern of the
ship. She is only about 60 feet long by about 15 broad. As it is I
have a bunk in what would have been a well-ventilated little cabin,
had it not been for rough weather which came on later in the night
and which necessitated the closing of the window.</p>

<p>Friday, July 16. The rougher weather came and the boat began
to pitch and roll. Luckily I slept for the most part. At about 6.30
the captain called me to breakfast with him. I got up rather groggy
from the sea, but managed to wash my face and get to the little
messroom, where the cook started to bring eggs, bacon, coffee, etc.&mdash;and
then I had enough and had all I could do to reach my bunk
again without getting seasick. I was kept on the verge of it until
after 10, when we arrived off Nome.</p>

<p>This, however, meant no relief. There was no bay, no dock, no
shelter for even such a small boat, and so we anchored a few hundred
yards off the shore along which stretch the long line of unpainted
(mostly), weather-beaten frame dwellings of this northern capital.</p>

<p>By this time I barely keep my feet, but they lowered a heavy rowboat,
and several of us&mdash;there were four other men passengers&mdash;are
helped to tumble in. I get back, and to steady myself catch hold
of the borders of the boat, only for this the next moment to be
dashed against the larger boat with my hand between. It was almost
too much, the seasickness and added to it the very painful hurt.
Fortunately the fingers were not crushed, just bruised badly&mdash;they
might easily have been mashed to a pulp.</p>

<p>They row us in and we tumble out on the sand, and there is no one
to receive anybody or take any notice. However, after a while there
comes accidentally an old two-seated Ford. Three of us crowd in,
leave the few bulkier things we brought along on the beach unguarded,
and are driven to the other end of the town, to the Golden
Gate Hotel.</p>

<p>This is a big old frame building, out of plumb in several directions.
There is no one in the spacious lobby. However, after a time some
one, not looking much like a proprietor&mdash;more like a groom at work&mdash;comes
out from somewhere and without much ado shows us each to a
room. Mine smells musty, old sweat and blankets and mould, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
looks out on a dilapidated tin roof&mdash;must ask for another. Finally
get one "front" for $3&mdash;the other was only $2.50. Musty too, but
fairly large, and with a double bed with, at last again, clean covers.</p>

<p>Unshaven&mdash;in the khaki worse for rain and work&mdash;with fingers
so sore they can not bear a touch, feverish, and head still dizzy&mdash;I go
to lunch. On my way stop at Coast Guard building&mdash;no one there;
at the Roads Commission&mdash;office empty; at the Customs&mdash;not a soul.
But at the courthouse they tell me where Judge Lomen sometimes
lunches, and so I go there. It is near by&mdash;nothing here is far distant&mdash;and
so I soon sit at Mrs. Niebeling's, a justly famed Nome's
"for everybody," at a clean table and to a big civilized dinner.
Order reindeer roast&mdash;find it this time, in my condition, not much to
boast of&mdash;one could hardly tell it from similarly done beef&mdash;and
begin on the coffee when in comes a young man, asks me if I am the
doctor, and introduces himself as Mr. Alfred Lomen, the judge's
son; and in a minute or two in comes the judge himself, a kindly
man of something over 70. It all makes me feel a lot better, though
still weak. Have rest of lunch together and talk, but do not get
very far in anything that interests me; but the judge takes me to
the Catholic Fathers here, who have an orphanage somewhere near
where I want next to go, and leaves me with Father Post. The
father is kindly, but himself does not know much, and so makes
arrangements for me to meet next day Father Lafortune, who works
among the Eskimo.</p>

<p>Then I go once more to the Coast Guard building and meet Captain
Ross, in charge. The <em>Bear</em>, I learn, has just arrived here, and
is soon going north. She is my godsend, evidently. So Captain
Ross sends me over to see Captain Cochran. The meeting is good,
and I have a promise to be taken to the cape and some other stations.
But the <em>Bear</em> goes first to coal at St. Michael, and then will make
a visit to St. Lawrence Island. So I propose to go to Teller first,
see what I can of the Chukchee-Eskimo "battle field" near there,
and be taken from there by the <em>Bear</em>. The priests give me some
hope for getting there over an inland route, but later on tell me one
of the boats of the orphanage which is located in that region is away
and the other has broken down, so that there will be no possibility
of making the trip through the Salt Lake and to Teller. But the
<em>Victoria</em> (the Seattle boat to come to-night) will go to Teller. Unfortunately,
if weather is rough or there are no passengers she will
not stop at Nome, so all is again uncertain. The <em>Silver Wave</em> goes
northward next Monday, but I have a dread of her. All of which
is put down merely to show slightly what an explorer without a
boat of his own may expect in these regions.</p>

<p>Nome, Saturday, July 17. Poor night again&mdash;it surely seems to
be the fashion in Alaska. The <em>Victoria</em> came at night (or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
should be night). The ramshackle big frame hotel, with partitions
so thin that they transmit every sound, got about 40 guests, and next
room to mine came to be occupied by two women who had visitors,
female and male, were taken out for a ride after 12 and returned
about 2 a. m. One of them, or their visitor, had a perpetual vocal
gush, the others chimed in now and then, and a strong male voice
added the bass from time to time, with old Fords noisily coming
and going outside, and people going up and down the stairs. So
sleep for some hours was out of the question. And there was nothing
to do about it.</p>

<p>After breakfast went to meet Father Lafortune, a Catholic missionary
priest to the Eskimo, who speaks their language well and
who promised to accompany me to their habitations; and together
we spent the forenoon on one side of the town, among the natives
of the Diomedes, and most of the afternoon on the other end among
the people from King Island. It was a good experience, resulting
in seeing a good many of the Eskimo and getting some information,
a few photographs, and quite a few old specimens. Then we went to
the parsonage, where I got a few good photos from Father Lafortune's
collection. He is a matter-of-fact, always ready to help,
natural he-man, rather than a priest and teacher, and a great practical
helper to the natives, who all are his friends.</p>

<p>Also saw Judge Lomen, arranged for lecture to-morrow, saw
Captain Ross about the <em>Bear</em>, and various other people; but there
is not much to be obtained here about old sites and specimens. Telegraphed
Institution, and also to the Russian consul at Montreal for
permission to visit the Great Diomede Island. Evening packing.
Natives bring walrus ivory, some excellent pieces. Weather whole
day cloudy, threatening, occasional showers, cool but not cold.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 18. Heavy sleep 10 p. m. to 7 a. m., regardless of
a typewriter going in the next room and the women (now quieter,
however) on the other side.</p>

<p>Forenoon spent in talking with people and attending a little
service, for the natives mainly, at the Catholic Church of Fathers
Post and Lafortune. Poor, simple, but sincere and interesting.</p>

<p>After lunch more consultations, then a visit to bank where they
smelt gold dust (even to-day), and then a lecture on "The Peopling
of America," at the courthouse. Well attended, and many came to
shake hands after. Then a dinner, with examination of a number
of interesting and valuable specimens, at Judge Lomen's. Among
other objects there is a duplicate, in ivory, of the broken double ax
from the Yukon, the two grooves and even the break being well
represented. Evening&mdash;examination of specimens at Reverend Baldwin's.
Cloudy, cool, threatening, but stormy weather abating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">About Nome</span></h3>

<p>Due to the delay with the <em>Bear</em>, the next few days until July 23
were spent at and about Nome. They proved more profitable than
was expected. Numbers of interesting specimens were found in the
possession of some of the dealers, and more of those of scientific
value were secured either through gift or by purchase for the
National Museum. These collections consisted of objects of stone&mdash;i. e.,
spear points, knives, axes, etc.&mdash;but above all of utensils,
spear points, effigies, etc., some of them of remarkable artistry and
decoration, were made of walrus ivory that through age has turned
"fossil."</p>

<p>Among the stone objects were several axes made of the greenish,
hard nephrite which came from the "Jade Mountain" on the Kobuk
River. The objects from fossil ivory came principally from the St.
Lawrence Island, the Diomede Islands, Cape Wales, unknown parts
of the nearer Asiatic coast, and here and there from the Seward
Peninsula.</p>

<p>A large majority of these objects are now collected by the natives
themselves, who assiduously excavate the old sites, and are sold at
so much per pound as "fossil ivory" to crews of visiting boats or to
merchants at Nome and elsewhere, to be worked up into beads,
pendants, and other objects of semi-jewelry that find ready sale
among the whites.</p>

<p>In addition a certain part of these objects is reserved by the
natives, especially those of the Diomede Islands, and worked up by
themselves. The more striking the coloration of the ivory, the more
desirable it is for the beads, etc., and the less chance of the object,
regardless of its archeological or artistic value, to be preserved.
The most artistic pieces, nevertheless, are usually disposed of separately,
bringing higher prices than could be obtained for beads.</p>

<p>In this way hundreds of pounds collectively of ancient implements,
statuettes, etc., are recovered each year from the old sites on
both the Asiatic and the American side of the Bering Sea, and are
cut up, their scientific value being lost. Most of the fossil ivory,
fortunately, consists of objects which, though showing man's workmanship,
are of relatively little scientific value; nevertheless it was
seen repeatedly that specimens of real archeological value and artistic
interest would be destroyed if their color and texture made them suitable
for some of the higher-priced jewelry.</p>

<p>The Eskimo, as repeatedly found later, have not the slightest hesitation
about excavating the old sites, and whatever they can not
use, which as a rule includes animal and human bones, and in fact
everything else except stone tools and ivory, is left in the excavated
soil and lost. The amount of destruction thus accomplished by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
women, children, and even men each year is large and promises to
grow from year to year as long as the supply lasts. This means that
unless scientific exploration of these old sites is hastened there will
be little left before long to study.</p>

<p>The fossil ivory trade has become such that many of the officers
and the crews even of the visiting vessels, including the revenue cutters,
engage in buying the ivory from the natives and cutting it up in
their spare time into beads and other ornaments. A captain of a well-known
boat who with his crew visited in the summer of 1926 a small
island on which there is an extensive frozen refuse heap containing
many bones and tools of the natives who once occupied the place,
exclaimed, "Gad, there's $50,000 of ivory in sight."</p>

<p>The boat crew took away about "2 bushels" of it, or all that could
be removed from the extensive frozen pile. I saw some of this ivory
later, all cut up, but with a number of the pieces still showing old
human handiwork, and some beads made of other parts of the lot
were brought later to my office in Washington.</p>

<p>If American archeology and ethnology are to learn what they need
in these regions it is absolutely essential that they take early steps
for a proper exploration of the old sites, besides which every effort
should be made by the intelligent traders, missionaries, teachers, and
officials to save the more artistic and characteristic pieces of human
workmanship in the old ivory, and bring them with such data as
may be available to the attention of scientific men or institutions.
It would in fact be of much value, and the writer has suggested
this to the Governor of Alaska, to establish a local museum at Nome,
where such objects could be gathered and saved to science.</p>


<h4>ABORIGINAL REMAINS</h4>

<p>The coast of which Nome is now the human center, up to Cape
Wales, together with the nearer islands, was occupied by the Maiglemiut
(Zagoskin), or Mahlemut (Dall et al.) subdivision of the
Eskimo. They were a strong group, and great traders. During
the Russian times the Aziags, from what is now the Sledge Island,
with probably others from the coast, visited yearly for trading purposes
as far as St. Michael and the Yukon, while the Wales people
were known to trade up to fairly recently as far as Kotzebue, both
at the same time having trading connections with Asia.</p>

<p>Of these natives, with the exception of those at Wales, there
remains but little. On Sledge Island there are only two dead villages,
and on the coast from Port Clarence to far east of Nome there
is not a single existing native settlement. A few remnants of the
people live in Nome, but they have lost all individuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Dead sites are known to exist from west to east, at Cape Wooley;
at the mouth of the Sonora or Quartz Creek; at the mouth of the
Penny River&mdash;some natives are said to still go to fish there in summer;
at the mouth of a small river 3 miles east of Nome; both west
(a larger village) and east (a small site) of Cape Nome; and 18
miles east of Nome (the "Nook" village).</p>

<p>Most of these sites have been peopled within the memory of the
oldest inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kind aid of the Reverend Doctor Baldwin, I was
able to visit several of the sites east of Nome, more particularly the
Nook village, and it was still possible to find two skeletons and a
skull on these sites.</p>

<p>The Nook site must have been one of considerable importance.
It was an especially large village, or rather two near-by villages, in
one of which I counted upward of 30 depressions, remnants of the
semisubterranean houses with vestibules, such as are elsewhere described
from the Yukon.</p>

<p>Here a clear illustration was had of what changes on sites of this
nature may be wrought in a short time by the elements.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, I was assured, there were still many burials
and skeletal remains scattered along the coast near the Nook village.
Then in 1913 came a great southwestern storm, which at Nome
ripped up the cemetery and carried away some coffins with bodies,
scattering them over the plains in the vicinity. Since that storm
not a vestige remains of any of the burials or bones near the large
Nook village. On prolonged examination I found nothing but sands
overgrown with the usual coast vegetation. Everything had been
carried away or buried and the pits of the houses were evidently
themselves largely filled in.</p>

<p>The burials on this coast west of Golovnin Bay were evidently all
of a simpler nature than those on Norton Sound and the Yukon.
There is plenty of driftwood, but for some reason this was not hewn
into boards with which to make burial boxes. The dead were merely
laid upon and covered with the driftwood, though this was done,
as later seen on Golovnin Bay, rather ingeniously. One of the two
skeletons found near Cape Nome, an adult male, lay simply among
the rocks on the lower part of the slope of the hill.</p>

<p>Old sites, though often small, may be confidently looked for along
all these coasts in the shelter of every promontory, at the mouth of
each stream, and on the spits which separate the ocean from inland
lagoons (as in the case of the Nook village).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nome&mdash;Bering Strait&mdash;Barrow</span></h3>

<p>Friday, July 23. Received word to be on the <em>Bear</em>, which arrived
yesterday, before 10 o'clock this morning. Due to the shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ness
of the water the boat, though drawing only 18 feet, stands
far out from the shore and makes a pretty sight, looks also quite
large in these waters where there is nothing above a few hundred
tons.</p>

<p>Am soon at home. The captain's cabin, with three beds, is nicely
furnished, but has the disadvantage of being situated at the very
rear of the vessel, above and beyond the screw. There is another
passenger, a teacher-nurse for Barrow. I take the isolated bunk on
the right, and this becomes my corner for the next six weeks.
Toward 11 a. m. the wind begins to freshen, soon after which we
leave for St. Lawrence Island. After midday the wind increases
considerably, waves rise, and the <em>Bear</em> begins to plunge. Before
the afternoon is over the wind blows a half gale and we are being
tossed about a great deal. Have to take to bed. The boat is being
tossed up and down and in all directions. Resist in vain, then at
last become ill, and this passes into a long spell of about the worst
seasickness I have ever endured. There were a good many sick on
the <em>Bear</em> that evening and night.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 24. Wind and water slowly quieting down, and
the boat is approaching Cape Chibukak off St. Lawrence Island,
where is located the main of the two villages of the island, known
as Gambell. The <em>Bear</em> gradually approaches to within about a
half mile of the shore, where we anchor. The water here is quieter,
and before long a large baidar (native skin boat) is shoved off from
the land and approaches our boat. This is the usual procedure
when the sea permits. There are no docks, and closer in there is
danger from rocks and shallows. There are a number of natives
in the boat, together with the local teacher, and each one, including
the teacher, carries a smaller or larger bag of fossil ivory, various
articles made of fresh ivory, and some other objects, for sale to
the officers and crew of the boat. They climb on our deck, where
they evidently feel quite at home, and in a few minutes carry on
a busy trade and barter with everyone. I succeed in getting a
fine fossil ivory pick; but the main supply had evidently been preempted
and I only see it later in the possession of the officers, who
kindly let me have what is of less value to them and more to
science.</p>

<p>Some of the Eskimo bring, in addition to the ivory, other articles
for sale&mdash;fish, birds, and the meat of the reindeer, which are for the
ship's messes and constitute very welcome additions to the diet.
Besides all this the natives also frequently bring skins of foxes and
even bear, which also find buyers. In return the boats carry off the
mail and such supplies as they have obtained by barter or purchase.
These visits are mutually enjoyable as well as profitable occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and afford one the opportunity of seeing many of the natives, even
if prevented, as in this case, from visiting their village.</p>

<p>The Eskimo impress one here as in every further locality as a
lively, cheerful, and intelligent lot, good traders, and advancing
in many ways in civilization. The latter is perhaps especially true
of the St. Lawrence Eskimo, who from what was seen now and
later must have had especially good missionaries and teachers as
well as a considerable freedom from bad influences from the outside.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savonga</span></h3>

<p>About 40 miles east-southeast of Gambell is the second and smaller
village of the St. Lawrence Island, known as Savonga, which was
the object of our next visit. It was here that we were to buy two
or three reindeer carcasses, the animals being killed and dressed for
us by the natives in an astonishingly short time. The little village
is prettily situated on the green flat of the elevated beach. It consists
of less than a dozen modern small frame dwellings. One of
these, that of the headman, Sapilla (who regrettably died during the
following winter), is of two stories&mdash;a unique feature for an Eskimo
dwelling in these waters. Here we were visited by three boats and
the previous scenes were repeated, only, due to the proximity of
a rich old site, there were more objects of old ivory.</p>

<p>The captain made me acquainted with Sapilla, whom I found
remarkably white-man-like in behavior. Then the ship doctor, not
feeling very well after yesterday's storm, filled my pockets with
tooth forceps and I was taken to the shore, to see the women and
children who would not venture out and to attend to any tooth extraction
that might be needed.</p>

<p>We were considerably farther from the shore than even at Gambell,
but I was sent on one of our motor boats and so it did not take
long to land. Upon landing we came to bright and clean and
smiling little groups of women and children, full of color in their
cotton dresses, and I was soon in one of their houses. All these
dwellings were built by the Eskimo themselves, and it was a most
gratifying surprise to find them as clean and wholesome as any
similar dwelling of whites could be. Moreover, these houses were
furnished with stoves, chairs, tables, crockery and other utensils
exactly as if they were those of a good class of whites, with the smell
of the seal, which as a rule is so clinging to and characteristic of
the Eskimo house, barely perceptible.</p>

<p>It was a busy and interesting hour that I spent at Savonga. I
saw probably all the inhabitants that were at home; pulled five
teeth&mdash;the teeth of these quite civilized people are no more as sound
and solid as were those of their fathers and mothers&mdash;and found and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
purchased cheaply many smaller objects of fossil ivory, which they
excavate from a near-by old site.</p>

<p>These objects are obtained from an old village located on the coast
about 4 miles farther east, on or near the North Cape, visible from
our boat. The natives excavate in this site as far as it thaws every
summer, and find many objects. They, moreover, make an occasional
trip to the two little rocky Punuk islands located about 12
miles south of the East Cape of the St. Lawrence, which, though
accurately charted by the Russians as early as 1849, yet until the
summer of 1926 remained practically unknown. On one of these
islands there is now known to exist an extensive frozen refuse heap,
containing large quantities of old ivory implements as well as other
objects of scientific interest.</p>

<p>The land visit was a great tonic after the wild and mean preceding
night, and I did not relish at all the <em>Bear's</em> whistle calling us
away. What a great thing it would be if a revenue cutter could for
just one season be given to science!</p>

<p>Sunday, July 25. Left St. Lawrence 9.30 last night, sea quieting.
We are now passing, on our right, King Island, isolated rocky mass.
Day fair, cool, water getting smooth.</p>

<p>About 50 miles north one can now see plainly Cape Prince of
Wales (pl. 5, <em>a</em>), and to the left, hazy, the two Diomedes. We are
now 95 miles from St. Lawrence. On really clear days one could see
from here even the Asiatic heights. Therefore, from the latter on a
clear day one sees the Diomedes, the Cape, the highlands beyond,
and King Island, while a little farther south there is on such a day
a good view from Asia of the St. Lawrence Island. All this was in
good weather easily reached from Asia and must have been utilized
from the earliest time in passing onward from one continent to
the other.</p>

<p>We can now see also much of the coast in the direction of Teller
and the York Mountains behind.</p>

<p>From hour to hour there is growing on one a profound appreciation
that the Bering Sea was a most favorable amphitheater of
migration, particularly from the less hospitable Asia eastward into
America. And practically the whole trend of native movements to
this day is from Asia toward America.</p>

<p>Later in the day, now a fine, bright summer day, arrive off Wales.
Here again anchor far out. Last year the <em>Bear</em> grounded here and
our captain is apprehensive. Wales is a straggly village&mdash;or two
villages&mdash;located on a large, flat sandy spit, dotted with water pools,
and projecting from the Seward Peninsula toward Asia. Near by
are old sites, probably of much archeological value, and in these
for some weeks now excavations have been carried on by Dr. D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Jenness, of the Victoria Memorial Museum of Ottawa. Here also
is located an exceptionally educated and observant teacher, Mr. Clark
M. Garber.</p>

<p>A big umiak comes to us with many natives bringing the usual
trade, and on it, much to my pleasure, are both Doctor Jenness and
Mr. Garber. Doctor Jenness asks to go with us to the Little Diomede
to do some work there. He has had encouraging experience here,
finding evidences of occupation dating many centuries back, and
has collected some valuable specimens, including a few with the
fine old curved-line decoration. Mr. Garber gives me some valuable
information about the skeletal remains of this place and engages
to collect for me, who can not leave the boat, a few boxes of these
specimens, which promise is fulfilled later.</p>

<p>The natives are a jolly and sturdy lot, even though they bear, and
that since their earliest contacts with whites, a rather bad reputation.
That this is founded in some fact, at least, is told us in the
annals of the Russians, and is also shown by the little structure on
the hillside off which we are anchored. This has a tragic and at the
same time quaint history. It is the grave of a missionary Doctor
Thornton, who was killed, we are told, by two local young fellows.
These were apprehended, sentenced to die, and were to be shot by
their relatives, which all evidently found quite just. On the appointed
day they were taken out to the burial ground, helped to
prepare their burials, one asked yet to be allowed to go to the village
to get a drink, went and returned, and then both were shot. The
executioner of the boy who went to get the drink is said to have been
his uncle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Diomedes</span></h3>

<p>Late that night we leave slowly for the Diomede Islands, the
nearer of which is only about 18 miles distant. The two islands
lie, as is well known, just about in the middle of the Bering Strait.
One is known as the larger or Russian, the other as the smaller
or American Diomede. The boundary line between Russia and the
United States passes between the two. Both islands have been occupied
since far back by the Eskimo. To-day there is one small
village on the American and two small settlements on the Russian
island.</p>

<p>July 26. Up at 5.40, breakfast 6, and off in one of our staunch
motor boats, with Jenness, for the Little Diomede. Countless birds
flying in streams about the island.</p>

<p>The island is just a big rock, with barren flat top and steep
sides, covered where inclination permits with great numbers of larger
and smaller granite bowlders. There is neither tree nor brush here.
The village, if it deserves that name, with a school, occupies an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
easier slope, facing the larger island across a strait seemingly about
a mile broad. There are but a few dwellings, due to local necessities
and conditions built above ground and outside of stone. One that
was entered showed a dark fore-room, a storage attic, and a cozy
somewhat lighted living and sleeping back room, entered through
a low and narrow entrance. The houses seem to be built on old
débris of habitations, and there are refuse heaps, one of which was
eventually worked in by Doctor Jenness, though without much
profit.</p>

<p>The bowlder-covered slope above the village was the burial ground
of the natives. (Pl. 5, <em>b</em>.) Unfortunately most of the skeletal remains
have been collected by a former teacher and then left and lost.
With Doctor Jenness and the present teacher, himself an Eskimo, we
climb from bowlder to bowlder and collect what remains. The work
is both risky to the limbs and difficult in other respects. The large
bowlders are piled up many deep; and there being little or no soil,
there are all sorts of holes and crevices between and underneath the
stones. Deep in these crevices, completely out of sight or reach, nest
innumerable birds (the little auk), and their chatter is heard everywhere.
But into these impenetrable crevices also have fallen many
of the bones and skulls of the bodies that have been "buried" among
the bowlders, and also doubtless many of the smaller articles laid
by the bodies.</p>

<p>The burials here were made in any suitable space among the rocks.
The body was laid in this space, without any coffin and evidently
not much clothing. About it and on the rocks above were placed
various articles. We found clay lamps, remnants of various wooden
objects, the bone end pieces of lances, and finally one or two pieces
of driftwood to mark the place. Here the bodies decayed and what
was left had either tumbled or was washed by rain into the crevices.
It was suggested, however, that much may have been taken by dogs
and foxes. Some of the skulls and here and there one of the larger
bones remained, to eventually be covered by moss and eroded. With
the help of Doctor Jenness and the teacher I was able to find five
male and seven female crania in fair condition, which will be of
much value in the study of this interesting contingent of the Eskimo.</p>

<p>No evidence in the graveyard among the rocks of any great antiquity,
nothing more than perhaps a few scores of years. But traces
of older burials would surely be completely lost among the rocks,
though they may lie in the deep crevices and holes where they can
not be reached.</p>

<p>Upon return am treated to a cup of good hot coffee&mdash;never can
get a real hot cup of coffee on the boat&mdash;and excellent bread, made
by the Eskimo wife of the teacher; and see his family of fine chubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
children. Can not help but kiss his girl of about 10&mdash;she is so
fresh and innocent and pretty. Obtain also from the wife of the
teacher a good old hafted "jade" ax, though she hesitates much
to part with it&mdash;it used to belong to her grandmother; and from
the teacher himself a number of interesting articles in old ivory.
Leave Doctor Jenness. Have learned to like him much, both for
his careful work and personally, in our short association; and at 11
a. m. return to the boat.</p>

<p>Cold, but calm and sunny. Sit on boxes at the very end of the
good old <em>Bear</em>. See Asia, the two Diomedes, and Seward Peninsula,
all in easy reach, all like so many features of a big lake. Pass around
Greater Diomede.</p>

<p>There never could have been any large settlement on the Diomede
Islands&mdash;they are not fit for it. The Great Diomede has just two
mediocre sites, which are occupied now each by about half a dozen
dwellings. A small old settlement, a few stone houses, has also
once existed, I am told, on the elevated top of the larger island opposite
the Little Diomede. On the latter only the one visited&mdash;everywhere
else the steep slopes or walls come right down into the water,
and there is even no landing possible (or only a precarious one at
best) except where we landed. The old natives of the Little Diomede
are said to have believed that another village had once existed farther
out from the present site and that it has become submerged. The
evidence cited (told by the native teacher) is not conclusive, and
no indication of such a settlement could be seen from the beach. But
in front and possibly beneath the native houses, in the old refuse,
there may be remnants of older dwellings.</p>

<p>Just passed from Monday to Tuesday, and then back to Monday,
all in a few hours&mdash;the day boundary. We are now just north of the
Bering Strait and see all beautifully, in moderate bluish haze.</p>

<p>A grand panorama of utmost anthropological interest. A big lake,
scene of one of the main migrational episodes of mankind. Sea
just wrinkling some, day calm, mostly sunny, mildly pleasant,
with an undertone of cold.</p>

<p>How trivial feel here the contentions about the possibilities of
Asiatic migrations into America. There can be no such problem
with those who have seen what we now are witnessing. Here is a
great open pond which on such days as this could be traversed by
anyone having as much as a decent canoe. As a matter of fact it
has always been and is still thus traversed. (Pl. 6, <em>a</em>.) The Chukchee
carried on a large trade with America, so much so that we find
the Russians complaining of their interfering with their trade.
(Pl. 6, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>.) The Diomede people stand in connection on one hand
with the northeastern Asiatics and on the other hand with the whites
as far as Nome, where most of them go every summer to sell their
ivory and its products and bring back all sorts of provisions. And
in the same way the King Islanders come every summer to Nome,
on the east end of which, as the Diomedes on the west, they have
their summer habitations. (Pl. 7, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>.) Only a year or two ago,
the natives tell, an Eskimo woman of St. Lawrence Island set out
alone in a canoe with her child to visit a cousin on the Asiatic coast,
50 miles distant, and returned safe and sound after the visit was
over.</p>

<p>To bed dressed&mdash;the captain tells me we shall soon be at Shishmaref,
on the north shore of the Seward Peninsula, and that he will
have me called, if I want to visit the village.</p>

<p>Awake 11.30 p. m. At 11.45 word comes that we have arrived and
a boat is getting ready. On deck in five minutes. Of course it is
still light&mdash;there is no real night any more in these regions.</p>

<p>Have a cinnamon roll&mdash;the night specialty for the crew on the
<em>Bear</em>&mdash;and a bowl of coffee. The natives, two boats full, already
coming, and a fine full-blooded lot they show themselves to be. They
are accompanied by Mr. Wegner, a big, pleasant young teacher.</p>

<p>Leave natives trading and set off in ship's boat. The <em>Bear</em> is
anchored about 1⅓ miles off. Fortunately fairly quiet or we should
not be able to go ashore. Teacher and a young English-speaking
native go with us. We have the launch and the skin whaleboat.
Anchor first off shallow beach and transfer into the skin boat for
the landing.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 27. It is about 12.30 a. m. Many native women,
youngsters, and some men gather about us at the school. Talk to
them&mdash;explain what I want, which is mainly skulls and bones&mdash;all
quite agreed. Take two young natives, some bags, and proceed to
where they lead me.</p>

<p>Find, about half a mile from the present village, a big and important
old site, which existed up to the white man's time. But
dunes on which burials were made and house sites have been largely
graded by a fox-farm keeper and trader, Mr. Goshaw. He had
gathered many skulls&mdash;shows me a photo of two rows, at least 40&mdash;will
not tell what he did with them. Says he sent "many things to
the Smithsonian," but can give no details, "and to the universities,"
but will not mention which. Also "buried a lot." Bad business.</p>

<p>Gathering what is possible from the débris thrown out by the
Eskimo working for the fox farm, we proceed rapidly from mound
(dune) to mound. Find burials still on the surface in situ&mdash;i. e.,
nearly buried by the rising carpet of the vegetation&mdash;but skulls gone.
Many of those on remaining heaps imperfect, but at least something
can be saved. Collect all that is worth collecting. See Mr. Goshaw&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>get
but little out of him. Donates a few archeological specimens of
no great value&mdash;has no more.</p>

<p>We hurry on to the other village and burial ground, almost a mile
west of the present settlement. Find only a small pile of bones,
with one whole male skeleton of fairly recent date.</p>

<p>Then back, as fast as possible, the Indians carrying the bags with
bones, and load on boat. My shoes and feet have long since become
thoroughly wet, after which Mr. Wegner loaned me wool socks and
native shoes that protected my feet. But now these must be left
behind and I have to get into my wet, cold shoes&mdash;socks too wet.
Officers in a hurry to get back. It is now 3.00 a. m.; the sun rose
about 1.30. Pay my men, change shoes, photograph women (pl. 8)
and then men&mdash;all pleasant and willing. See a few poor articles of
archeological nature&mdash;not worth getting; and after a hearty handshake
with the teacher we take off through the somewhat rougher
water to the whaleboat, then on to the motor boat and the ship. Arrive
with six bags of specimens, reaching boat just a little after 4.
Sleepy captain meets us, but luckily shows no grudge, though this
stop and his loss of sleep were essentially for me. Though it would
seem they could have readily waited for our going ashore until morning,
or have given me a little more time at the Diomedes, which
would have brought us here later. Am too much awake now and
worked up to sleep. Lie down a while but fully awake. Total sleep
last night 2½ hours. But it was worth it, except for the vandalism.</p>

<p>Pack&mdash;inadequate boxes&mdash;until 3.30 p. m. Whole collection made
last night put in order. But back and knees stiff. Weather two-thirds
fair (my own estimate), some wind, sea choppy. Lie down but
can not sleep.</p>

<p>At 5.30 off Kotzebue. Due to shallowness of water must anchor
far out of sight. At 6 go to land in ship's larger launch. Waves
rather bad, much tossing about and spray, have to get behind the
canvas canopy that is raised over one seat. It is 15 miles from where
the <em>Bear</em> is anchored to the Kotzebue village&mdash;over two hours of (at
times) rather violent tossing up and down and sidewise. Run for
a part of the time not far from beach&mdash;a number of isolated, orderly
fish camps&mdash;lots of fish drying. Wonder at not getting seasick
again&mdash;it must be the open air or difference of movement.</p>

<p>Kotzebue village lies around a point on a not very high, flat bank,
facing the bay of three rivers (Selavik, Kobuk, Noatak). As we approach
I count over 50 clean tents of Eskimos, about 15 frame houses
and stores, and many skin and other boats on beach or in water.
Many natives hurry to meet us.</p>

<p>Go ashore. Thomas Berryman, the trader, with the local judge
and two or three other whites come also to meet us. After getting ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>quainted
inquire about possibility of exploring the Kobuk and reaching
the Koyukuk and Yukon. But all that I learn is uncertain and
discouraging. There are but few native villages on the river, all Eskimo;
and higher up the water is rapid, necessitating much hauling
of the boat by the natives, which is costly; upon which follow three
or four days' portage. The trip would cost much, and no loads
over 40 pounds to a man could be carried.</p>

<p>Only a few old sites hereabouts are known by those whom I have
a chance to ask. Say there is a somewhat important one at Cape
Krusenstern. Mr. Berryman has from there a big stone (slate)
lance. He also has a huge piece of serpentine, over 80 pounds in
weight, with a moderate depression in top and some cutting (old
native work), said to have been used as a lamp. Wants to keep this
and spearhead, but donates an old rusty tin box full of smaller
things and promises to obtain skulls for us; and I get a similar
promise from a man (probably one of Mr. Berryman's storekeepers)
from farther up the country.</p>

<p>Later meet here Mr. Chance, the school superintendent of these
parts; a young and not prepossessing man, but one who steadily
improves on closer acquaintance. Learn from him of a skeleton
recently dug out from the ground under the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>See many natives, all Eskimo, good looking, clean, and kind.
Some mix bloods, but the majority pure. Good to moderate stature,
well proportioned though not fat body, medium to somewhat lighter
brown color, physiognomies less typical Eskimo than hitherto and
often strongly like Indian. Too late and dusky to photograph.</p>

<p>Go to see the teacher and find that the skeleton he dug out was
placed by him in an open box, pushed as far as possible under the
rafters of the floor of the schoolhouse and covered with gravel and
earth. There are four of us&mdash;start hurriedly digging for it, remove
with shovel, hoe and arms about a ton of the "filling"&mdash;and can not
reach the box. It is 10 p. m., the wind rising, officer comes and
urges me to get back to the boat. So must leave with promise that
the box will be gotten out and await me on our return from the
north. Have by this time decided the best policy will be to go
with the <em>Bear</em> as far as she may go. Load empty boxes, some packing&mdash;and
one of the young white men who have been digging with
us runs up from the distant schoolhouse announcing that they
"struck" the box. Urge him to run back as fast as he can and get it.
Luckily the postmaster and a good many others who came to see us
off delay us; also the transfer of the mail and boxes to the larger
boat. Finally, after a good many anxious looks, I see at last the
two young men appear, one with a wheelbarrow on which is the box
of bones. Bones look not very old, and Eskimoid at first sight, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
take box, which contains a good deal of gravel, carry it through the
very interested Eskimo to the boat, all get in, hurried good-bys to
everybody, and we are off.</p>

<p>A two and a half hours' trip once more, and the last more than
half of it very rough. Such tossing and dancing and dipping and
twisting, with the spray, fortunately not cold, shooting high up at
times, or an angry wave splashing over. But the boat is large and
strong and so eventually we reach the <em>Bear</em>, which was completely
out of sight until about an hour after we started, and in a few minutes
off we go to the north. A little fruit, bed, and know nothing
more until near 7 the next morning. It was a long day&mdash;over 25
hours in a stretch without a wink. Yet did not feel bad; the work
and good nature of people about and those met with, with some
success, are good tonics.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 28. All of us have to consult the calendar to be
sure of the day and date.</p>

<p>Sort and wash Berryman's specimens&mdash;a nice lot of little things,
mainly of stone, slate, flint, etc.</p>

<p>Then go after my bones. Find the spray made the earth and
gravel in the box thoroughly wet, so that it is necessary carefully to
excavate all the bones. Find a male, rather short-statured, typically
Eskimo. May have been a burial of the Russian times. Wire for all
details. Must dry bones. Meanwhile try to catch up with notes.
Toward evening expect to be in another village. Weather fair.
Have passed the Arctic Circle during night, but it is not cold nor in
any way strange here. Sunset coloring lasts long and passes into
that of sunrise&mdash;no real night, no stars; but moon seen late at night
and far to the south.</p>

<p>May this weather continue, for in rough weather landing at any of
these places&mdash;there are no harbors whatever and always shallows and
bars and shoals&mdash;would be extremely risky or impossible and my
work, for which I feel ever more eager, would suffer. If only I could
see all worth seeing, and stay a little longer when I find what I am
after.</p>

<p>We reach Kevalina. It is just a schoolhouse and about seven sod
houses. Only a native school teacher, from whom I do not get much.</p>

<p>No remains or old site very near, but an old village, with "good
many things," exists on the Kevalina River within a few hours' distance
(by canoe) from Kevalina.</p>

<p>Natives bring old adzes (mounted by them, however), and a harpoon
handle from the old site&mdash;bought.</p>

<p>Spend rest of day in washing, sorting, and packing specimens.</p>

<p>After supper am invited to the officers' room and given by Lieut.
M. C. Anderson a fine selection of old ivory harpoon heads and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
things. Many of these are from the old site on the St. Lawrence
Island, and especially from little isles off that island named Punuk.
All this strengthens the importance of those islands for regular
exploration.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 29. In anticipation of being called up again during
the night, at Point Hope, which is evidently another important
spot for archeological exploration, for the natives are said to bring
many old articles for sale each year, I do not undress and go to bed
earlier, but have, because of the anticipation, closeness of air, and a
cat jumping on my face just as I am dozing off, a very poor night;
and no call came after all. In the morning there are cold showers,
the sky is much clouded, and the wind keeps on blowing from the
north-northwest, threatening, the officers say, to drive the ice toward
this shore, which would be bad for us. It is cool and disagreeable.
We have anchored to the south of the spit on which stands the village
and can not unload or get ashore. Nor can the natives come
here to us.</p>

<p>The village consists of a schoolhouse, a little mission (Rev. F. W.
Goodman), an accumulation of houses, semi-subterraneans, and tents.
A few tents are also seen a good distance to the right&mdash;a reindeer
camp. Otherwise there is nothing but the long, low, sandy, and
grassy spit projecting far out into the ocean.</p>

<p>Later. The north-northwest still blows, and so the ship has to
anchor to the south of the long spit on the point of which is the village.
Of this but little can be seen, just a few houses, and it seems
near and insignificant.</p>

<p>The captain is evidently waiting again for the natives to come out,
and I am helpless. Finally, however, a boat is made ready and I
am taken to the shore with the mail. This is piled on the beach, and
with two officers we start to walk toward the dwellings opposite to
us, which are the mission. Heavy walking in the loose sand and
gravel of the steep beach, and as we ascend it is seen the buildings
which seemed so near to the shore are about a mile or more away.</p>

<p>A man coming toward us&mdash;the missionary, Archdeacon Goodman.
Tell him my mission; says he has some business on the ship, but will
come, and there will be no trouble in helping me to a "good deal of
what I want," which sounds fine.</p>

<p>In the absence of the missionary, go to see the teacher. The school
is over a mile in the direction toward the point. Find him at home
and helpful. In 15 minutes, with his aid, engage two native boys,
give two sacks to each, and send them out over the long flats (old
beaches) to pick up every skull and jaw they can find. They go
cheerfully, and we depart shortly after to see Mr. La Voy, a movie-picture
man, who has been staying here for some time making movie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
pictures of the natives, and at the same time collecting all the
antiquities they could bring him. We go to see his collection, but
find him not home; has gone for mail. The rare mail in these regions
is, of course, the most important of events. So back to the school
(a good many rods from the sod house part of the native village to
the left), and then&mdash;it is now near noon&mdash;to the mission, a good
mile from the school and more from the village.</p>

<p>Road staked on one side with whale ribs about 2 rods distance.
Flats on both sides show many parts of bleached human bones. They
are a part of the old extensive burial grounds. Unfortunately, about
two years ago the predecessor of the present missionary had most of
the skulls and bones collected and put in a hole in the new cemetery,
now seen in the distance to the right of the mission. This new
burial place is surrounded by a unique whale-rib fence. Reach mission,
but no one there. Does not look good. Try one building and
door after another&mdash;no one&mdash;learn later that the missionary has no
family. Twenty minutes to 1. Nothing remains but to go back to
the school for some lunch. So leave my raincoat, camera, and remaining
bags (expecting to do main work on the buried bones) and
hurry back to the school, which I reach just after 1, and, thanks to
their late clock, just in time for a modest lunch, but with a real hot
cup of coffee. Queer that the only genuinely hot cups of coffee I
got on this journey were furnished by Eskimo&mdash;for Mrs. Moyer, the
wife of the teacher, is an Eskimo.</p>

<p>Then comes the mail and Mr. La Voy, and I go to see the latter's
collection.</p>

<p>Find a mass of old and modern material, of stone, bone, and
wood. All the older things are from an old site on the point. It is
an important and large site, as found later (at least 50 houses), which
the natives (getting coffee, tea, chewing gum, chocolate, candy, etc.,
for what they find) are now busy digging over and ruining for
scientific exploration. Women dig as well as men, confining themselves
to from 2 to 3 uppermost feet that have thawed; but even thus
finding a lot of specimens. Bones, of course, and other things are
left and no observation whatever on the site is made. It is a pity.</p>

<p>Mr. La Voy donates some stone objects, mainly scrapers, and then
I go with a native he employs to the "diggings." Find much already
turned over&mdash;one woman actually digging&mdash;but very much more still
remaining. Examine everything&mdash;site evidently not ancient but of
the richest&mdash;and then return with the woman to get some of her
"cullings."</p>

<p>On the way am called by a man whose sod house (semisubterranean)
we pass. We sit on the top of his house and soon establish
a regular trading place, with a big flat stone as a counter. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
after another the native women and men bring out a few articles,
good, bad, or indifferent, lay them on the stone, I select what I want,
lay so much money against the articles, and usually get them.
Everybody in the best of humor. The natives surely enjoy the
sport, and so do I, if only I was not hurried. Thus trade for at
least an hour until my pockets are bulging. Then once more to the
school and once more to the mission. In the latter get my things,
as nobody is there yet, Doctor Goodman having doubtless been delayed
on the boat. I hear that there are prospects of both him and
Mr. La Voy going north with us on a little vacation. Send the coat
with spare bags to the school by a native I meet, while I go to look
at the rib cemetery and photograph it. Find the bones have been
interred in its middle and a low mound raised over them, so there
is for the moment nothing to do there. Therefore go over the
plain a little farther, picking up a few odds and ends, a damaged
skull, and finally, from a fairly recent burial box, a fine skull with
its lower jaw. Then attempt to pass a pool of water and sink in
the mud to above my rubber boots, so that the icy water runs in,
wetting me thoroughly, and gurgling henceforth with every step
in the shoes. Try to get these off but can not. The feet must be
congested. So spill out all I can by raising the feet, and then do
some hard walking which takes away the cold.</p>

<p>Evening, though no dusk approaching. Sit on gravel to empty
more water from shoes, but can still hardly get one off. And just as
I succeed I see, across another long pool, two men, one with a cap of
an officer of the ship, waving their arms, evidently signifying to
me that the time is up and I am to return. Call to them to wait.
Impossible to make them hear me or for me to hear them. All
here is elusive&mdash;enchanted-like&mdash;distances, sounds. Finally they
stop. I catch up with them after passing a broad ditch, and learn
that the ship is about to sail and they are waiting for me. My coat,
however, and collections are still at the school, over a mile away,
so once more it is necessary to hurry to the school and then back
to the ship. So things go when promises go wrong and one is
alone under a constant apprehension.</p>

<p>The boys collected four bags full. Moreover, they undertook to
bring them toward the boat, and are bringing the last two just as
I approach the beach. There are Eskimos on the beach with dog
teams and sledges waiting to cart off what was unloaded from the
ship. Photograph one of the teams and then on into the boat and
to the <em>Bear</em> with the four bags, a box full, part of another bag, and
all pockets full of specimens. Only to learn when we reach the
boat that both Doctor Goodman and Mr. La Voy are going with
us and that the former after supper is still to go and get his things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
from the mission. I have no boat to go back with, and so lose
several hours.</p>

<p>July 30. Gloomy morning, windy, cool, sea not good. Do not
feel easy. But need to pack. One of the officers, Boatswain Berg,
lends me his short sheepskin coat, and I pack up to lunch. The sea
is getting worse. Have but little lunch and soon after have to take
to bed or would again be sick. To avoid the pitching of the end
of the boat where my bed is I go to the dispensary and lie until 6.
From 6 on the sea moderates somewhat, so that I am able to have a
little supper. After that go to officers' wardroom, play two games of
checkers with the doctor, get some more specimens from two of the
officers, and retire.</p>

<p>When I boarded the <em>Bear</em> it became plain to me that I must earn
as much as possible the sympathetic understanding of my work by
both the officers and the crew, and so I gave two talks, one to the
officers and the other to the men, telling them of our problems in
Alaska, of the meaning and value of such collections as I was making,
and of other matters that I felt would be useful on this occasion. As
a result I had throughout the voyage nothing but the friendliest feelings
of all and their cooperation. Sincere thanks to the officers and
the crew of the <em>Bear</em>, from the captain downward.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 31. At 4.30 a. m. suddenly a heavy bump forward,
followed by several smaller ones. Ship rises and shivers. Have
struck ice floes. Going very slowly. Further bumps at longer or
shorter intervals and occasionally the ship stops entirely. Sea
fortunately much calmer.</p>

<p>Up at 7. We are in a loose field of ice&mdash;aquamarine-blue ice
covered with hillocks of snow, all shapes and sizes, as after a hard
winter on the Hudson, only floes mostly larger and especially deeper.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast hear walrus and seals had been observed on
the ice, and shortly before 9 the captain comes down hurriedly to tell
us they have just spied&mdash;they now have a man in the crow's nest up
on the foremast&mdash;a white bear.</p>

<p>Run up&mdash;everybody pleasurably excited&mdash;to the front of the ship.
See a black-looking head of something swimming toward a large ice
floe about 500 yards in front of us. As we approach the head reaches
the floe, then a big yellowish paw comes out upon the ice, then the
shoulders, and finally the whole bear. The officers hurry forward,
each with a gun. Soon men all there. Some one fires. Bear stands
broadside watching us. The bullet goes way over. Then other
shots&mdash;still missing&mdash;water spouting high in many places. Bear
bewildered, does not know what to do, lopes off a little here and there,
stops again, looking at us, and now&mdash;we are less than 100 yards from
him it seems&mdash;a bullet strikes him above the loin&mdash;we can see him jerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and the red spot following. He runs clumsily, but other shots follow,
some seemingly taking effect, and then he drops, first on his belly,
then, twisting, turns over on his back. A few more movements with
his paws and head, and he lies still, quite dead. Can not but feel
sorry for the poor bear, who did not know why he was being killed,
and had no chance.</p>

<p>A motor boat is lowered and goes to get him. They find on the floe
the remains of a seal on which he fed. Tie a rope to him, drag him
into the water, tow him to the <em>Bear</em>, which has stopped and where
all stand on the bows in expectation and with all sorts of cameras,
and prepare to hoist the brute aboard. Captain says it is the second
case of this nature in 20 years. Ropes are fastened about the big
body, attached to a winch, and the big limp form is hauled up, though
not without some difficulty, due to its size and weight. All stand
about him, examine, photograph. They will let the natives at Wainwright
skin it and give them the flesh. It is a middle-sized, full-grown
male. It shows only two wounds, the one in the side and one
where the bullet passed through his mouth, knocking out one of the
canines.</p>

<p>Cold&mdash;must put on second suit of underwear. Very gloomy, but
storm abated. No land in sight&mdash;above Cape Lombard all is flat.
It rains in that direction. We meander among the floes, now and
then bumping and shivering. Should a wind come up and blow the
ice landward we would be in danger of being closed in and stopped
or delayed.</p>

<p>Evening. Arrive off Wainwright. Village recent&mdash;older site 20
miles away. People the usual type of Eskimo. Visit the village, but
soon return.</p>

<p>After supper the boat stops&mdash;fear the ice. Another passenger is
added here, Jim Allen, the local trader, with a bagful of white
fox skins and a bear skin. Conditions becoming a bit crowded.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 1. No movement to-day. They are apprehensive
of the ice, and so we stay here, the one place of all where there is
nothing for me to do. Of course there are the natives, but with the
constant uncertainty as to when we shall start and a lack of facilities
I can not do much with them.</p>

<p>The weather is quiet but still cloudy, though the sun may possibly
peep out. Ice seen in the offing. Would be more interesting to be
in it, as yesterday. The bear has been skinned, cut up, and we shall
try some of its flesh at noon. Rest of day quiet but still mostly
cloudy, though occasionally a little of pale, lukewarm sun. At
3.30 give lecture to the officers and fellow passengers on the subject
of evolution. Seems quite appreciated. Reading, writing, and
walking the deck fills the time. Ate a little of the bear meat&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>what
tough, otherwise not much different from reindeer or even beef.
If better prepared (especially roasted on coals) would be quite
palatable.</p>

<p>Yesterday there were several flurries of snow, none to-day, but air
cold enough to make a long stay outside disagreeable.</p>

<p>Toward evening Captain announces that he is going to try to reach
Barrow, about 80 miles northeastward, and soon after supper we
start. He also tells me we may be there at or not long after midnight
and so to be ready, for the boat will be unable to stop more
than an hour or two. As the only place where a few skulls and
bones may be found is about 1½ miles outside of the village and it
takes a good 30 minutes to make a mile over the tundras, I shall
have to rush once more. But I am promised a man to help me.</p>

<p>August 2. With clothes on, and anticipation, slept poorly. Ship
stopped about 1 a. m. and I imagined we were off Barrow. But on
rising find that we have gone on and then backward again, encountering
ever more ice. It is cold and foggy outside, and cloudy and
gloomy. We now meander among the big floes, now and then bump
into one until the whole ship heaves and shivers, and occasionally
the siren, stop for a while to diminish the shock. We are now on
way back to Wainwright. If we only could go as far back as Point
Hope, where there is so much of interest. I might have stayed over,
but would surely have reproached myself for missing the remainder
of the coast.</p>

<p>Back off Wainwright, cold, windy, sky gloomy as usual.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon go with the trader to land, to visit the site
of an older village, about a mile down the shore. Walk along the
beach. Cold wind, raincoat stiffens. Walrus meat and blubber
chunks (slabs, etc.) along the beach at several places, also a large
skinned seal. Traces, as one nears the village, of worked stones, but
all waterworn and no finished objects. At one place in bank, about
3 feet deep, a layer of clear blue ice about 20 inches thick&mdash;strangely
pure ice, not frozen earth or even inclusion of any dirt or gravel.</p>

<p>Village site small, along the edge of the low (about 10 feet) bluff.
Count remains of eight dwellings. Some animal bones, but nothing
else on surface or in vicinity. Burial place not seen. Companion
says there is nothing.</p>

<p>A simple supper at the trader's, prepared by his Eskimo wife, and
good company: Doctor Smith, of the Geological Survey, with two of
his men; Jim Allen, the storekeeper, a big, good-hearted fellow;
La Voy, the big, active movie man, who knows all the gossip and
enjoys telling it with embellishment; and two men of the trader.
Menu: Soup, boiled reindeer meat, underdone biscuits, coffee.</p>

<p>After supper go to a meeting at the school, where our missionary,
Doctor Goodman, is to talk to the natives. Large schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
crowded. I talk through an interpreter&mdash;a serious disadvantage&mdash;on
cleanliness. Fine study for me on the many present, though like
elsewhere on such occasions they are mainly women and children.
Good many Indianlike faces, though cheekbones more prominent
and more flatness between them. But hair, low foreheads, eyes (except
in children where they are more superficial, less sunken, and
with more epicanthus than in Indians), lips, and other characteristics
the same as in Indians. Some of the faces are strong, many
among the younger pleasant, some of the young women handsome.
A moderate number of mix bloods, even among the adults. Color
of skin in full bloods medium to submedium brown, exactly as in
full-blood Indians along the Yukon, but cheeks more dusky red.</p>

<p>The behavior of these people is in all important points radically
that of the Indian, but they are more approachable and open and
matter-of-fact people. More easily civilized. Good mechanics.
Less superstitious, more easily converted to white man's religion.
And good singers. Their singing at the meeting in the schoolhouse
would have shamed a good many whites in this respect.</p>

<p>Except for epidemics, I am told, these natives would more than
hold their own in numbers. They are fecund, if conditions are
right. Sterility is rare. They marry fairly young.</p>

<p>August 3. Still standing, though we had to pull out farther
south and away from the shore. The water was pretty rough and
I had to go to bed again, but weather moderated.</p>

<p>We are in touch with the world through the ship's radio, but get
more trash&mdash;same all through the radio service in Alaska&mdash;than
serious news. Spend time in reading, talking; some play solitaire
games; captain and Allen play cribbage. Deck too small for any
outside games, even if it were not so cold.</p>

<p>Ice floes floating about us, now scarce, now thicker; water splashing
against them and wearing them out into pillared halls, mushrooms,
and other strange forms. Due to their snow covering, the water
upon them, so far as it results from melting, is sweet, and in it swim
many small fishes. It snowed a bit again to-day.</p>

<p>August 4. No change, except that the sea is somewhat calmer,
and for a while we have once more seen the sun, but it was hazy
and just mildly warm, while the same wind, from the sea, even though
now subdued, has an icy undertone. It snowed a little this morning.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 5. Sea calm, atmosphere hazy, but the wind
has turned at last slightly offshore and the sun penetrates through
the mists, until it conquers and shines, warm and bright if not
wholly clear, once more. Ice visible only on the horizon. At 7.15
we start on another effort to reach Barrow.</p>

<p>Pass Wainwright, and all is well until after lunch, when fog
(though fortunately not thick) develops and the floes increase until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they are as thick as at the first attempt in this same region. Heavy
bumps and strains follow one another and the boat must often go
very slow or even stop altogether. Sometimes the heavy ship just
staggers from the impact, but the floes are generally broken by the
shock and swirl away out of our way, or scraping the ship pass
to the rear. All aboard show new interest and energy. The forced
stops and inaction were dulling even to the crew.</p>

<p>File a wireless to be sent from Barrow. It will reach Washington
to-morrow after we shall have started on the return journey.</p>

<p>Two dogs on board fight fiercely. An officer, the owner of one,
trying to separate them is bitten by his own through a finger.</p>

<p>A marine, in swinging the heavy lead with which they are constantly
sounding the depth, gets the cord caught about his hand
and suffers a bad sprain with fracture.</p>

<p>The captain's little black cat, Peter, helps to entertain us by his
antics. No wonder sailors in their often monotonous existence like
all sorts of mascots.</p>

<p>Friday, August 6. Of course our dates got mixed, and more than
one has to consult the calendar and count. The <em>Bear</em> had to turn
back once more last night; ice too heavy. Anchored, however, not
far to south. This morning very cloudy, rainy, chilly, but wind
from near to east, and so from about 6 a. m. we are once more laboriously
on our way. Now and then a bump, heave, stagger, then again
the screw resumes its cheerful song. We are passing through the
most dangerous part of all the coast here where many vessels have
been lost, sometimes whole small fleets of whalers. But very few
come here now&mdash;we have seen but one since leaving Kotzebue. They
call this stretch "the boat graveyard."</p>

<p>Saturday, August 7. Stalled, about 30 miles from Barrow. Anchored
in the protection of a great grounded flat, in a clear pond of
water, with ice all around it, but especially seaward, where the pack
seems solid. Some open water reported beyond it, but wind (wild)
keeps from the wrong quarter and the captain will make no further
attempt until conditions change. Of course it is cloudy again and
has rained some during the night and morning, but the temperature
is somewhat higher, so that one does not need an overcoat and
gloves, although the officers wear their sheep-lined short coats which
are nice and warm.</p>

<p>After noon asked the captain for the skin whaleboat to explore
the shore. The latter is nearly a mile distant and shows about 60
feet high dirt bluffs. Got the boat and went with the boatswain.
Berg, a young "hand," Weenie, and the movie man, La Voy.
Rowed with La Voy. Had a wholesome two and a half hours
exploring. Found a little stream, with traces of native deer camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
(collected two seal skulls); a moderate number of flowers and grasses
(collected some mushrooms); some fossil shells from the bluffs; and
two Eskimo burials. One of these, a woman, nearly all washed away
and lost; of the other, a man, secured the skull, jaw, one shoulder
blade and part of a diseased femur with corresponding socket
(mushroom arthritis), also the two humeri. A good specimen. Returned,
rowing again, near 4. All there playing cribbage and
solitaire.</p>

<p>Am tempted to walk to Barrow; but there are some streams in the
way which it might be impossible to ford. Moreover, no one knows
the distance.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 8. Morning finds us once more thwarted, and
standing at our place of refuge. No change in conditions, but there
will be a change of moon to-night, so I at least have hopes. In my
travels I learned too much about the moon not to believe in it.
Toward evening ice begins to move out.</p>

<p>Monday, August 9. At 12.30 a. m., unexpectedly, a new start.
The wind has turned at last (new moon!) to northeast, but is mild.
Soon in ice. Many bumps and much creaking and shaking. Captain's
collie gets scared and tries to get into our beds, one after
another. But very little sleep under these conditions.</p>

<p>In the morning we find ourselves in a thicker ice field than any
before, with floes on all sides. Boat barely creeps. Toward 10 a. m.
further progress found almost impossible, and so forced to turn backward
once more. However, can not even go back and so, near 12,
anchor about a mile offshore opposite a small river with lagoon-like
mouth and two tents of natives&mdash;"Shinara," or "Shinerara."</p>

<p>Ask captain for a boat to visit and explore the coast. Consents,
and so at 1 we go forth, about eight of us, with the captain's dog.
Reach Eskimo, photograph the group. All look remarkably Indianlike.
Then go to look for skeletal material. Nothing near, so return
for the Eskimo boy. He leads me about a mile over the highland
tundra to two burials in boxes&mdash;not old. Look through crevices
shows in one an adolescent, in the other a female (or a boy) with
hair and skin still on. Leave both.</p>

<p>Then into the boat once more after buying some fossil teeth, and
with the boy Isaac&mdash;his father is Abraham&mdash;try to go into the river,
and soon get stuck in the stickiest mud (oily shale) imaginable&mdash;great
work to clean even the oar with which we had to push ourselves
off. Land then on the beach and for the next two hours explore
that side of the basin. Find remains of two small settlements&mdash;seven
huts in all, none very old.</p>

<p>Gather five skulls with parts of four skeletons, most bones missing;
also some mushrooms, several interesting humeri of seals, and a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of pumice-like fossil bone. Near 4.30 begins to rain a bit so we hurry
to boat, and in a little while, after depositing Isaac near his camp,
reach the <em>Bear</em>.</p>

<p>Eskimo on shore had two skinned seal lying on the ground, and
there were many reindeer horns. A pile of them was over a fire,
being smoked.</p>

<p>The wind has been the whole day from the northeast, the long-wished-for
wind, and the ice has moved out sufficiently to induce
the captain to make another start. So at 5 p. m. off we go again,
and for quite a while the screw sings merrily, until we reach some
remaining ice, when there are more bumps and staggers.</p>

<p>The waters about the ship show, whenever calmer, the heads of
swimming seal, grown and little. But they are wary and keep at
a distance. Otherwise the only live things are an occasional gull,
and rarely a couple of ducks. In the icy water, however, on and
about the floes, are seen again numerous small, dark fish (from the
size of a big minnow to that of a tomcod); and along the shore swim
merrily hundreds of very tame and graceful little snipes, lovely small
birds, too little, luckily, to be hunted.</p>

<p>Little enthusiasm about my collecting, but the boatswain and some
at least of the men are genuinely helpful. I believe some of the
others are a bit superstitious. But I get some chance at least, and
that is precious.</p>

<p>Expect to reach Barrow before 12 p. m., and to start back before
morning&mdash;a big chance for some sleep again if I want to do some
collecting. Sleep, through the frequent lack of it, has become a
kind of obsession in one's thoughts, yet when there were chances during
the days of waiting it would not come.</p>

<p>August 9, evening, to 10 next morning. This is a land of odds and
wonders. In the morning things looked hopeless; toward evening
the wind has driven away enough ice to make a narrow open lane
near the shore, and utilizing this we arrived without difficulty
at 8 p. m. at the long unreachable Barrow. At 9 boat takes us
ashore. At 9.30 p. m. I start with an Eskimo and a seaman (Weenie)
from the <em>Bear</em> on a collecting trip over about 3 square miles
of tundra behind Barrow, and at 12.30 return to ship with four bags
of skulls and bones. But sleep! Hardly any since 12.30 last night,
and very little after return to-day, for due to fear of ice they
called in everybody from shore before 3 a. m., and the newcomers
keep on walking and talking and banging with their baggage until
5, when, fearing a return of the ice, we start once more southward,
toward&mdash;it feels strange, but it is so&mdash;home. It was a remarkable
good fortune, our getting there thus and getting out again, as we
did, without damage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Barrow is a good-looking and rather important place. It stretches
about 2 miles along the low shore, in three clusters, the two main
ones separated by a lagoon. It has a radio station, a mission
hospital, and a school. There are over 200 natives here, and also quite
a few whites, including Mr. Charles Brower, the trader, observer
and collector, with his native wife and their family, the teacher, the
missionary and his family, and the nurses.</p>

<p>The burial place here is the most extensive in the Eskimo territory.
Taking the older parts and the new, it covers over a square mile of
the tundra, beginning not far beyond the site of the hospital and
extending to and beyond a small stream that flows over a mile inland.
But the burials were grouped in a few spots, the rest being barren.</p>

<p>This extensive burial ground is now about exhausted for scientific
purposes, except for such skeletons and objects as may have been
assimilated&mdash;i. e. buried&mdash;by the tundra. That such exist became
quite evident during our search, and they naturally are the oldest
and most valuable. We secured two good skulls of this nature. They
were completely buried, only a little of the vault showing, and had
there been time we should doubtless have found also parts of the
skeletons. The skulls were discolored brown.</p>

<p>Of the later skeletal material we found but the leavings, the best
having been carried off by other collectors. There were remnants
of hundreds of skulls and skeletons, but for the most part so damaged
as not to be worth saving. Nevertheless our diligent midnight
search was not in vain, and we brought back four sacks full of specimens,
the Eskimo carrying his with the utmost good nature. The
destruction here is due to sailors and other whites and to dogs, foxes,
and reindeer.</p>

<p>The reindeer herds, going in hundreds over the ground, help
materially to scatter and damage the bones. So, the older material
gone, while the more recent burials are, at least so far as the
younger element is concerned, quite worthless to science, containing
many mix bloods of all sorts&mdash;even occasionally with the negro
(men from the wrecked whaleboats). The collection now secured
was the last one possible from this locality, except through excavation.</p>

<p>Tuesday, August 10. The boat is now crowded. We lost one
woman and got three; also about five or six men&mdash;newspaper, movie,
radioman, a dog teamster, a trapper. Quite a variety, in every way,
and most are to go with us at least as far as Nome. They will have
to hang up two hammocks in our little cabin each night, and some
must sleep elsewhere.</p>

<p>Packing the whole morning. Five boxes. My man of last night
helping, a fine, big young fellow. This aid in the work is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
boon to me, and the transportation of the many specimens by the
<em>Bear</em> down to Seattle or San Francisco will be a fine service to the
Institution.</p>

<p>The older of us, that is those who have been longer on the ship,
feel like veterans and are drawn closer together. The new lot,
heterogeneous, do not attract, particularly one of the women. An
older one, evidently a well-liked nurse, goes off at Wainwright,
which we reach once more at 8 p. m. Here goes off also Jim Allen,
the trader, who is a good fellow in a rough shell and whom I
learned to like. He helped us all a good deal while in the ice.</p>

<p>The movie man from Point Hope is a somewhat spoiled, gossipy,
and roughshod, but otherwise, a good-hearted big kid&mdash;not very
wise, but not mischievous, and more than efficient in his own calling.
Is 40, but already aging, like a weather-beaten poplar&mdash;not pine
or oak. Is violently against all "kikes," or eastern money-lending
Jews, from whom he used to borrow at usurious interest and who
sold him out once or twice when he could not pay.</p>

<p>Lost Jim Allen and dropped the nurse, but are still too many.
At 10 p. m., just as the minister and I have retired, there comes a
call for the former to go up. A couple of Eskimos have arrived,
with their friends, to be married. So he dresses and performs the
function. I am too weary to rise and dress to go and look at it.
He says it was quite tame. Then the anchor, and once more we
are off. No ice any more, and the sea has again a swell, which was
absent in the ice-covered waters.</p>

<p>Wednesday, August 11. Swell, but not bad, though one of the
women, another nurse, is ill, and the other, a "writer," etc., will not
get up for breakfast. Quite a problem now to get washed and
shaved. Both the minister (archdeacon) and the movie man like
to use perfumed things, and the former takes much time with his
toilet, so I endeavor as before to be first up.</p>

<p>August 12. A great day. Was called a little after 12.30 a. m., after
but little sleep (through anticipation), to examine a site ashore&mdash;a
coal mine, a water source, and possibly something human. Two
miles to shore, in semidarkness; no night yet in these regions. A
long tramp over the mossy and grassy tundra; mosquitoes. One
native igloo, and on a little elevation some distance off a grave of
a child; otherwise nothing. After examination of the coal strata,
a curious secondary inclusion in sand and gravel, and the stream
of water (good to drink, even if not clear), we depart and reach
ship again after 4 a. m.</p>

<p>Beginning to be&mdash;in fact am already&mdash;a "night doctor," for sure.
Never thought I could stand such doings, but am standing it, and
that even with some cold and bothersome night cough. But am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
sure short on sleeping, for it is impossible for me to catch up during
the days; am not a day sleeper. I suppose when one is most of
the time half hungry his mind naturally reverts to hunger, as mine
does to sleep.</p>

<p>We are due to-day again at Point Hope, and I am anxious for a
little time there.</p>

<p>At night. This was a day of harvest. Reached Point Hope about
3 p. m., but had to go around again to the other side, due to the
swell and surf on the north. I went to shore in the first boat, about
4 p. m. Doctor Goodman, with whom we are very friendly, was
with me and promised to go over and help me get some men with
whom I want to excavate the burial hole of his predecessor. But
when on the shore stays behind and remains. So we go on with my
man from the ship to the whalebone graveyard. Near there see
two Eskimo men with some dogs. They smile; so I tell them what
I want; in two minutes have engaged them; in about three more
we begin to dig, and in about five minutes after strike first bones.</p>

<p>My good friend the boatswain, Mr. Berg, comes to help, and as I
now have four to work I take a bag and go on collecting a little
more over the plains beyond where we are. Get a good bag. Find
another good-natured Eskimo, Frank, coming from fishing, engage
him to help carrying and eventually to take place of one of my first
workers, who is an old man. Then we see Doctor Goodman, far
away, coming to the mission. Borrow two more shovels from his
stock and a few coal bags. Meanwhile bone and skull pile is fairly
exposed from one side and top gravel partly removed, so I give up
intended trip to old village site and, as we were given only to 9.30
p. m., go to work on the pile.</p>

<p>A great deal here. More than anticipated, though all is a jumble,
with the long and other bones of the skeleton on the top. The work
is to get down in the moist gravel, disengage one bone and skull after
another as rapidly as possible, give it a rapid look-over, and either
save, if fairly well preserved or showing some special feature, or
discard. If saved, the specimen is handed to one of the Eskimo,
who cleans it of gravel, lays it out to dry a little, and then places it
gently in a bag.</p>

<p>Many of the bones and skulls were found so damaged that they
had to be left. But much was also good. The strenuous work, however,
had to go on without interruption and at the fullest possible
speed, if the main part of what was there was to be saved. So no
supper, no stop for even a minute, until after 8 p. m. Sixteen bags
full, and some of the sacks quite spacious. At last had to give up&mdash;no
more time, no sacks, and lower down everything frozen as hard
as flint. The main part, however, secured&mdash;183 good skulls, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
hundred lower jaws, and a lot of long and other bones. This, together
with the rest of the material from this place, ought to give
us data of much value.</p>

<p>But now, how shall the lot be got on the boat. Luckily, one of the
Eskimo that has been working for me has a dog team and sled. So
I engage these; and shortly after we finish putting everything in
order&mdash;in the presence now of Doctor Goodman, who comes to look at
us&mdash;the man arrives, with a good-sized sled and 13 whitish dogs.
Load all the bags on&mdash;and then a sight never to be forgotten&mdash;the
dogs pulling the load across the tundra, depressions, gravels, right
down to the water's edge and to the motor boat that is waiting for us.
How they strained, pulled with all will, and obeyed. A wise leader
in front, six pairs behind. No reins, only a few calls from the
Eskimo, and they knew just what to do. Tried to photograph them,
but light already poor&mdash;advancing season. (Pl. 9, <em>a.</em> <em>b.</em>)</p>

<p>Then hurry to the teacher, not home; to La Voy, not home. Find
teacher in tent, sick, trembling; I fear beginning of typhoid. Did
not get anything for me in our absence. La Voy promised to give
me some things from his collections, but now is not here. A native
woman, however, meets me far out on the beach, and I learn she has
dug out for me since our first visit five good skulls from the ground&mdash;some,
she shows, deep to above the elbow. She has them near the
ship&mdash;we go on&mdash;on the road boys and women overtake me with a
few things to sell. Then the woman brings her skulls, in a bag on
her back, in excellent condition. I pay her for her trouble. Reach
our boat, and the bell on the <em>Bear</em> rings 9.30.</p>

<p>The bone pile&mdash;the sled and dogs and load over the tundra&mdash;the
woman carrying a native (seal) bag with skulls&mdash;will be three rare,
indelible pictures.</p>

<p>On the <em>Bear</em> at 10. A little sandwich, fruit, and a cinnamon cake
with coffee, and to bed. But irritating tire-cough keeps me up for
another hour.</p>

<p>Friday, 13th. Packing. A nice day. Toward evening stop at
Kevalina. Obtain a few things and pictures. To bed soon, but
cough still bothers. I have nothing for it; there is but little on the
boat in the way of medicines outside of the most ordinary things.</p>

<p>Saturday, 14th. Up 5.30, early breakfast, and 6.45 start once more
for Kotzebue. The <em>Bear</em> has anchored about 12 miles off, so do not
reach village until 8.35, and have to go back at 9.10. Rush to store,
get boxes, barrels, and packing. And then to the schoolhouse, where
I expect some information about the skeleton found under the house
and obtained on my former visit. Also promised information from
Mr. Chance, the supervisor, about old sites. But Mr. Chance is gone,
and no letter or message&mdash;it came later, to Washington. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
words with the teacher, and one of the boys from our boat is already
calling me.</p>

<p>Return at 11 a. m. and spend the rest of the day packing, finishing
just at supper. A curious sunset at 8, a horizontally banded sun,
several clear-cut, fairly broad, dark bands. Sea getting rougher.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 15. Bad sea, wind, waves, fog. Have to take to
bed and do without breakfast. Stay in until lunch. We could not
stop again at Shishmareff; could not get ashore. The next stop, late
afternoon, is to be at the Little Diomede, to take off Jenness; but if
too rough we shall go on to Teller. The wind is from the northwest
and the foghorn keeps on blowing.</p>

<p>The whole day continues rough, foggy, unfriendly. The ship can
not stop at the Diomede, nor go to Teller; obliged to go to Nome.
After supper all chairs and movable articles have to be tied up.
Most day in bed, but escaped real seasickness, and got some sleep.</p>

<p>Monday, 16. Weather moderated. We are in lee of the mountainous
part of Seward Peninsula. After breakfast off Nome, and at
11 a. m. in town. First stop at Lomen's. Then from one to another
till 4.55 p. m., when Dan Sutherland, the Alaska Delegate to Congress,
escorts me to the boat. Saw many friends, got some mail,
and, best of all, got a fine deposit collection for the National Museum
from Mr. Carl Lomen. The judge asked me for another lecture for
next Saturday, when we are to see Nome for the last time.</p>

<p>About 5 a. m. arrive at Golovnin Bay to take water. At this place
this is generally a day of partial rest and recreation for the crew.
The water is taken from a small stream fed by a spring that comes
out from a cave of the mountain, and is put direct into the whaleboats,
brought to ship, and pumped into its tanks.</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast the captain gives us the larger motor boat,
and with Mr. Berg and two of the seamen I start for a little survey
trip along the northern shore of the bay. In less than an hour we
reach a sheltered nook with a small stream, where there is an old
frame dwelling with some out-structures, all evidently abandoned,
though various articles of use hang or lie about, including several
guns of old patterns.</p>

<p>On a bluff to the left of the house are six burials, some old, wood
near all rotten, some more recent. The latter, two in number, both
show a large animal skin covering of the body, besides which the
latter shows remnants of clothing. Secure two good skeletons,
practically complete; also head and a few parts of a newborn (or
near) child. A unique feature&mdash;with one of the male skeletons is
found a complete skeleton of an eagle. Could have got also a female
skeleton, but was still unclean, and we perceived a small native motor
boat coming toward us from the reindeer camp about 1½ miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
farther inward. So we replaced everything (outwardly) and started
off to meet the native boat. Found in it two young men and three
women. Inquired about old sites and learned of one about 3 miles
farther inward.</p>

<p>Stopped at the reindeer camp. Found there about a dozen individuals.
Got more information, also a young man to go with us,
bought for the <em>Bear</em> a dozen good-sized silver salmon&mdash;caught this
morning and lying for protection against flies, in a pool of water&mdash;and
left for the old site "around the point."</p>

<p>A nice site, but small. Fine beach for bathing if it were in a
warmer climate. Remains of about a half dozen semisubterranean
houses. A copper nail from one shows they were not very ancient.
And no burials left, save one, more recent, of a child, most of which
is gone. But there is a green elevated plane rising from the beach
and we soon find several varieties of berries, especially large and good
blueberries, a variety of huckleberry, and a sort of wine-tasting
dwarf blackberry. Collect enough for immediate consumption&mdash;a
most welcome diversion in every way&mdash;and get some for the captain.</p>

<p>Leave near 1 p. m. A little lunch on boat, then once more the
reindeer camp, where the young women make us good hot coffee
with as good biscuits as one could find anywhere. Buy more berries
from them, load our fish (12 salmon ranging about 12 pounds each,
for $3), and start off for another site just around Stony Point.</p>

<p>Round up one point, then another and another, up to five, and by
that time the going has become so rough that we get much tossed
about, ship water, dog gets frightened and near sick, and just
as we reach what we thought must be the last point there juts out
still another. It is now so rough that the boatswain thinks we could
not land, and so nothing remains but to turn back to the mother
boat. Reach there near 3.30 p. m. Soon all boats are hoisted, and at
4 the <em>Bear</em> is on her way to St. Michael.</p>

<p>August 18. Arrived about midnight off St. Michael; must stay outside
due to shoal water. Somewhat rough.</p>

<p>In the morning boat coaling, dirty work, so all who can go ashore.
Meet Mr. Williams again; buy a few native articles in stores, visit
Mrs. Evans, the teacher-nurse, who has on an occasion successfully
amputated a native's finger. The deputy marshal takes me to his
house, gives me some dried deer meat and smoked salmon strips, and
promises to be on a lookout for specimens for us. Near noon return.
Still rough.</p>

<p>At night a bad blow and the ship tossing a great deal, almost as
during the storm to St. Lawrence. Feel it considerably, but after
3 a. m. wind and water moderate. Feel effects of it, however, whole
morning. For an explorer to be ever in rough weather subject to
seasickness is a horrid affliction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>August 19. Off Nome once more. Everything, city, mountains,
appear exceedingly, unnaturally clear&mdash;not a good sign. After
9 a. m. go to town. Soon at the Lomens' headquarters, and the sons,
particularly Carl, bring out three smaller boxes full of things from
St. Lawrence and Nunivak Islands, and give me the choice of all.
And after I am through&mdash;near two hours' fast work&mdash;Carl adds one
beautiful tusk (carved) from Nunivak Island, and then adds another,
and two big bones of a mammoth, some as gifts, some as an addition
to his loan to our institution. Excellent men.</p>

<p>Lunch with Ralph and Carl; then a good walk in the open; and
then another lecture. All pleased, and two bring me specimens for
our museum. Slowly back to boat and 4.45 on the <em>Bear</em> again. Nice
day, but getting cooler and blustery.</p>

<p>Captain Ross comes to port, the graphophone starts its usual jazz
songs next (ward) room, then the supper, all visitors gone, and the
<em>Bear</em> raises anchor to be off for the north once more.</p>

<p>August 19, evening. A new, final chapter begins with to-day.
What will it contain when over?</p>

<p>August 20. Rough. Go north until in plain sight of the Diomedes
as well as Cape Wales, and then the captain decides landing would
be risky, if not impossible; and so reluctantly we turn back and
proceed toward Teller. What a tantalizing experience this must
have been to poor Jenness, who is waiting for us on the Little
Diomede, a most dreary place, to be taken off; and I, too, expected
collections at both the Diomedes and the Cape.</p>

<p>Saturday, August 21. Port Clarence, off Teller. This proved
a day never to be forgotten; for failure of a rigid system, for bad
weather, for strain and endurance, and nearness to almost anything.</p>

<p>My purpose was to utilize the <em>Bear's</em> visit to Teller for a survey
of a Chukchee-Eskimo battle field, of which I heard repeatedly
from the Yukon onward. Sometime during the earlier half of the
last century the Chukchee from Asia are said to have made an invasion
of the peninsula and to have reached as far as the Salt Lake,
east of Teller, when they were met by the united Eskimo and badly
defeated. The exact spot where this happened is, however, somewhat
uncertain, and it was to locate it, examine, and collect what
might be possible of the remains that were said to be still there
that I asked Captain Cochran to let me have one of the motor boats,
to which he kindly consented, uniting the trip with some topographical
observations for his own purposes.</p>

<p>The evening before I was told by the second officer that we shall
start some time soon after midnight for that part of the old battle
field&mdash;there seemed to be two of them&mdash;at the eastern point of the
Salt Lake. As a result could not undress, and after ship stopped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Port Clarence, near 11 p. m., had but a little rest. The call came at
4 a. m. A little breakfast, a package of lunch, and start at 5.10.</p>

<p>First note. Ship about 7 miles from Teller. Water deep enough
much nearer, but we came at night. Here there are already dark
nights between about 9 p. m. and 4 a. m., and so they were cautious.</p>

<p>Second. The officer says he has orders not to stop at Teller, where
there is an old Indian (Dunak) from whom I expected to get exact
bearings, and where there is also a white trader, Mr. Peterson, who
knows the place and might possibly have accompanied us.</p>

<p>Third. Distances, as usual, longer than estimated. We find eventually
that the destination is about 32 miles from Teller.</p>

<p>Fourth. A brisk head wind and sea retarding us.</p>

<p>Fifth. As we approach our spot, a shoal water, with grass, preventing
us from going straight to the most likely place, and no other way
was tried. It is 11 a. m. and already I hear an intimation that we
shall not have time for anything except to make a lunch. This is
the same officer, a very good man at his post but rigid and without
much interest in anything else than his own field, who after 10
miles' trip to Kotzebue gave us 25 minutes there, when it required
15 minutes alone to reach the school from the boat.</p>

<p>So we end by landing on the extremity of a spit there to make
lunch, and I have only the time it takes to prepare the latter. I find,
in hurry, remains of five old semisubterranean dwellings on the
northern side of the point, and about as many low mounds with
remnants about of rotten driftwood&mdash;undoubtedly old burials.
Probably the skeletons have been assimilated by the tundra vegetation
and blown material. A single native skull, a female, without
face, is lying about. Collected.</p>

<p>While lunch is being made ready the officer and the boatswain,
Mr. Berg, each shoot a duck. Then the lunch, a hurried loading,
and departure, after some delay in setting the sail, at 1.30 p. m. I
saw nothing that looked like a battle field. Its determination and
survey must be left for some future explorer.</p>

<p>Sail rapidly. Wind fresh, with us, also waves. Cross Salt Lake,
and Tussoc "River." About 4.30 reach Grantly Harbor and wind
increases; also waves. We run fast, and well enough, but the
umiak (skin boat) we are pulling begins to suffer. It rides crazily
and is jerked over the seething waves. The crossbar by which it is
partly held breaks, and now the boat goes more sidewise, with water
lapping over its border and getting in. Wind now quite a gale,
breaking waves everywhere&mdash;every now and then a big one&mdash;whitecaps
all over. A dim view of Teller in distance, when the skin
boat begins to fill more rapidly and sag. Must stop engine&mdash;waves
toss us like mad&mdash;one could be thrown bodily out of the boat if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
not careful in bending or moving and holding. The sail comes
down and the mast is laid down, a bad piece of work. Berg and
Pete Brant (an elderly trapper with us but formerly of Coast
Guard Service at Nome, a good sailor and knowing these waters)
work very hard and well. The skin boat has to be pulled alongside
and bailed out by young Weenie, a very hard and dangerous task.
Mr. Berg's rain hat ("souwester") blows off and is lost in the
seething waves. Later Weenie nearly loses his&mdash;snatches it out
between the boats with a narrow escape for his head. Then Weenie
climbs into the skin boat&mdash;a brave act&mdash;and finishes the bailing, but
is much "in" after getting back. Then our big staunch motor
launch starts again at reduced speed. But the skin boat does great
antics and threatens to fill again or break; so Pete Brant holds the
rope and is jerked every now and then, until I fear that he may
any moment be jerked out into the waves and watch to catch his
legs. Fortunately he succeeds in preventing it, but there was a
slim margin.</p>

<p>It has drizzled or rained, besides the wind, most of the afternoon,
and there is a lot of spray to splashes from the waves. All this has
to be taken as it comes, but the water is not cold, and our boots and
oilskins give protection. Nevertheless my right knee to hip gets
thoroughly wet and chilly, and I was not alone. But there is little
time to think of such things. We see at Teller the waves breaking
high on the shore, some boats already on the beach and others being
driven there, a few people looking helplessly on.</p>

<p>About 5.50 we round the Teller spit and come in the lee of it into
calmer water. But the visibility over the water is probably not
over a mile now, and we see no trace of the <em>Bear</em>. The gasoline
supply is getting rather low; and all are more or less cold, though
dressed warmer than I and, due to their hip-high rubber boots&mdash;mine
reach only to the knee&mdash;not wet. I now shake a lot with
the cold, without being able to stop it. So we skirt the protecting
bluffs southward to where everyone thinks the <em>Bear</em> is, near a little
stream from which they were to take fresh water. But though we
all strain our eyes to the limit, there is no trace of the ship.</p>

<p>Thus reach Cape Riley and the stream, which is found dry, without
a drop of water. Get on the pebbly beach, turn skin boat over to
get the water out, and hurry to chop wood. No wood save the water
troughs, so chop these. Must have fire. I warm up a little by
running around and chopping. They pour gasoline on the wood,
make a big fire, cook a pot of coffee, and with bread and preserved
meat make a supper, though it is mainly coffee.</p>

<p>Near 8 and getting dark. Storm, outside of protection of cliffs,
unabated. There is a second watering place, 7 or 8 miles across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
bay, and our only chance to find the <em>Bear</em> is to rush for this. But to
do this we must go diagonally across the waves and similarly against
the wind&mdash;a bad prospect. Also, we have only just about enough
gasoline to reach the place. But there is no help.</p>

<p>Thus a new start, and before long we are once more in the waves.
It is now quite obscure. The waves break now and then and splash
over us. Before long the skin boat is again sagging and in danger
of sinking. Once more pull alongside and dangerous, exhausting
bailing by Weenie.</p>

<p>And so on, tossed, driven aside, but thanks to the good engine
never stopping. I hold to seat not to be thrown against things or
even out; the others are becoming gruff, irritable. And then Higsby
makes out a faint light far ahead. No one certain, but in a while
it seems moving. A solitary small light somewhere far on the shore,
probably, not the boat.</p>

<p>But soon another stronger light discerned, seemingly moving to
the left, and later several&mdash;the ship in all probability.</p>

<p>We toss and reel and stagger nearer, but motor still going strong.
For the skin boat they found at last a position in which it takes but
little water. Finally see decisively a blinking light, the mast signal.
We show our lantern a few times. Then the ship looms before us,
but there is still the risky task of getting alongside and aboard.
However, all is accomplished without real damage.</p>

<p>The cabin&mdash;the good and anxious captain&mdash;a little canned grapefruit,
and bed. But head falls and rises, the events of the day reappear,
wonder what has become of the trade schooner we saw being
driven on the beach&mdash;and so on until consciousness passes into deep
sleep. The <em>Bear</em> is fairly quiet, not in the brunt of the weather.
And this eventually moderates, so that a little after 4 we start again,
only to anchor once more at 6, a little below where last night we had
our supper.</p>

<p>August 22. Cloudy, drizzly, rough still, and wireless news of
widespread bad storms, even in the States. So we shall wait. One
more hope for my collections at the Cape and with Jenness.</p>

<p>Captain says this morning the officer misunderstood his orders
about Teller. The trip demonstrated a number of things. One of
the main and most gratifying was the sterling quality of the men
with me, officer, boatswain, motorman. Weenie, Pete, in the teeth of
real danger. They were all that men should be under such conditions,
which is the best way I can express it. The trip may have been
in vain so far as its scientific object was concerned, but it brought
a number of men face to face with life's stresses and found their
mettle of the truest quality, without exception, to witness which
was worth the whole experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>August 22-23. During the night have left Port Clarence and
endeavored once more to reach Wales and the Diomedes, to be again
turned away by fog and rough weather. The captain doubts if
there will be any more decent "spells." The season for this stormy
sea is too far advanced. Unable to land anywhere.</p>

<p>The day is followed by another horrid night, again off the St.
Lawrence Island. Boat tossing and heaving and rolling, waves
reaching and even splashing over the level of the high upper deck
in the back, everything tied tip and cleared or fastened, a danger
in making even a few steps of being thrown against something, or
on the deck of being thrown overboard, and everything constantly
cracking, creaking, with every few minutes an impact big thud-like
or a splash of a wave, the floor heaving and twisting; and thus from
before evening until morning. Then a trace easier, but the whole
day gloomy and rough and the night again more unsettled. To-day
better, wind which began east then turned northwest, then almost
north, now stopped, but a heavy swell is running, heaving us nearly
as much as yesterday. We have gone very slowly.</p>

<p>Have arrived off Savonga. The sky is now clear and there is
not much wind, but the swell is and keeps on such that, notwithstanding
the repeated calls of our siren, the Eskimo whom we
see above the beach near their boats, do not dare to launch these
and come, nor does the captain care to risk one of our own launches,
though we need fresh reindeer meat and all would like once more
to meet the nice lot of natives of this village. After a prolonged
wait and as conditions show no improvement, nothing remains but
to leave the island.</p>

<p>Our next stop, if the weather permits, is to be at Nunivak Island.
This is a large island off the Alaskan coast, well below the present
delta of the Yukon and some distance above Kuskokwim Bay. The
island is one of the least explored, and the people living upon it
one of the least known. It is only during the last few years that
a trading and a reindeer post has been established on this island,
and only the second year that there is a teacher. What little is
known of the natives, a branch of the Eskimo, shows that they have
many different habits from those farther north, in clothing, decoration,
etc. They make rather good black pottery, and from this
island come the most elaborate carvings in ivory, reminding strongly
of small totem poles. A photograph of a group of these people,
seen at the Lomen Studio at Nome, showed remarkably broad and
short faces, unlike the Eskimo of the north. All of which made me
very anxious to visit the island.</p>

<p>To be brief such a visit, though promised to me by the captain,
could not be realized. The waters about the island are so im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>perfectly
charted that in weather that continued half rough it was
thought unwise to risk a landing. I felt this keenly, as the various
other impossibilities of the trip. But I could never forget all the
unexpected help I received from the Revenue Cutter Service, for
which I was deeply grateful, and had to acknowledge the justice of
the captain's position. We came so near that the land birds from
the island were already about us, but then turned toward the
Pribilofs and Unalaska....</p>

<p>Only little remains to be told. At the Pribilof Island, St. Paul,
we stopped at night, to take on four live fur seals for the Academy
of Sciences of San Francisco, and there we ran once more into
stormy weather. Here are a few notes from this period:</p>

<p>August 27. Toward evening again a gale, southwest. At night
worse. Ship tossing rather wildly. No possibility to me of either
getting up or resting. Barely keep from being horribly ill again.</p>

<p>Later in night ship had to be turned back and just drift.</p>

<p>August 28. All day the storm continues. I could take no meals,
not even a drop of water. In bed and barely standing it. Ship
hove to at last and just drifting.</p>

<p>August 29. Gale keeps on just as bad, howling till 1.30 a. m.
Then it moderates somewhat and ship starts going again. Last night
we were only 60 miles from Unalaska, now a good deal farther out.
Steam, still in half a gale and big sea, until after midday, when, not
without some difficulty and danger, we reach the fine little protected
harbor of Unalaska. Feel weak, near worn out.</p>

<p>August 30, p. m. Rest, and all is well again. Secure a little rowboat
and go with old Pete Brant to near-by islands. Storm over
for the day and fair, though not entirely. Row, climb hills, pick
berries and mushrooms, watch a bearlike semiwild pig, out whole
afternoon, returning strengthened, refreshed. Only no appetite yet.
Found no traces of human occupancy, but heard of some in the
"Captain's Bay" and at other spots.</p>

<p>The few Aleuts in Unalaska at this time show physiognomies
akin to the brachycephalic Indian, and not the Eskimo type.</p>

<p>August 31-September 1. A new gale, with drizzles. Luckily we
are at a dock, but I can do little. They are cleaning the boilers and
coaling. Evening of 1st have a good dinner&mdash;captain and the rest
of us from the <em>Bear's</em> cabin&mdash;at a friendly local trader, Louis Strauss,
and after that give lecture on "Man's Origin, etc." Introduction
by Capt. Van Buskirk, local commodore of the Revenue Cutter
Service. Lecture well received, make numerous friends, get good
information. Strauss's supper was the first I could eat with some
taste and hunger. But the lecture did me good.</p>

<p>September 2. Coaling and overhauling of boilers finished. Gale
stopped. Ship leaves 1 p. m. Day fairly sunny. Everyone sees us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
off. Harbor and hills look fine, though sky again clouded. Outside
quite a swell after the gales. Pass the <em>Haida</em>, practicing with her
cannon. The <em>Algonkin</em> was here too, with the story of their visit to
the Punuk Islands. The fresh green steep mountains toward the
entrance of the harbor are refreshing to the eye.</p>

<p>Pass through Akitan. Pass picturesque, especially the outstanding
isolated rocks near the islands.</p>

<p>Toward evening, far to the left (east), see under the clouds a
glorious icy cone, the "Pogrovemoi," and later a lower but still great
mountain a little farther and to the right an old but not so very old
volcano. Other volcanoes there are, the captain tells me, now hidden
by the low clouds.</p>

<p>Have a new passenger, Mr. Charles Brower, the trader of Barrow.
Came from the <em>Brower</em>, ship of his own company, a little larger and
faster than the <em>Bear</em>, and going also to San Francisco, but with
poorer accommodations. Brings with him a box of archeological
specimens from the Barter Island, in the north. Examine them, but
find little of special interest.</p>

<p>It takes us a little less than 10 days of a fairly good journey to
reach San Francisco. Dock at Oakland late in the evening. The
next morning, after breakfast, the boxes and barrels with collections
are taken on the dock&mdash;a big pile. Then the Santa Fe officials
kindly run a flat freight car to the pile, the boxes, etc., are loaded
on, the main part taken to the freight depot, the most valuable ones
to express, shipped, and shortly after what remains of the expedition
is on the Santa Fe Limited for Chicago. It only needs to
be added that, notwithstanding the variety of receptacles and the
difficulties of packing, the collections reached the Institution without
damage to a single specimen. Thanks once more for the help
received in making all safe to the captain and officers of the <em>Bear</em>, to
Mr. Berg, the best of boatswains, to the carpenter, and to all those of
the crew who assisted.</p>

<h2>THE YUKON TERRITORY&mdash;SITES, THE INDIANS, THE
ESKIMO</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Tanana</span></h3>


<h4>BRIEF HISTORICAL DATA</h4>

<p>The Tanana is the largest tributary of the Yukon. It is over
600 miles in length, and in its breadth, though not in its volume, it
appears to equal, if not to exceed, the Yukon at their junction. The
first white men to see the mouth of the Tanana were the Russian
traders (about 1860), followed before long by the employees of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Hudson Bay Co. Dall says that it has long been noted on the
old maps of Russian America, under the name of the River of
the Mountain Men, while the Hudson Bay men called it the Gens-des-Buttes
River. (Alaska and Its Resources, 281-282.) Dall
mapped the junction of the river with the Yukon. The first who
descended a part of its course were two traders, Harper and Bates,
who reached the river higher up, sometime in the late seventies.
The name of Harper is preserved by having been given to the
big bend of the stream, 12 miles above its mouth. Its scientific
exploration begins only in 1885, with the passage down nearly its
entire length of Lieut. Henry T. Allen, United States Army;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
main work concerning the geography and geology of the river being
done in 1898 by A. H. Brooks.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h4>POPULATION</h4>

<p>The native population of the Tanana has always been remarkably
scarce. Dall obtained an estimate of their whole number as about 150
families.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Petrof, in 1880, thought they numbered perhaps seven
or eight hundred;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Allen in 1885 estimated them at between 550 and
600;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Brooks, in 1898, thought there were less than 400;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the
1910 United States Census gives the total number of the "Tenan-kutchin,"
full bloods and mix bloods, as 415.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>According to Brooks (Reconnaissance, 490-491), the Tanana natives
were separated into two geographic contingents, the eastern or
highland and the northwestern or lowland groups. The most easterly
group included the Indian settlements in the vicinity of Forty-mile
and Mentasta Pass trail; the northwestern comprises to-day
those from Nenana to the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>The Tanana Indians were generally regarded by other natives
as warlike and dangerous, but so far as their relation with the whites
was concerned there was little justification for this notion.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Physically
they were reported by Brooks to "average rather better than
the Indians of the Yukon" (Reconnaissance, 492). There are but
a few and scanty other references to them in this connection.</p>

along the sluggish portions of the lower Tanana. The largest villages
are at the mouth of the Cantwell and Toclat Rivers, and each
of these consists of a number of good cabins. In the intervening
region there are a number of isolated houses and fishing stations,
which are marked on the accompanying map."</p>

<h4>LOWER TANANA, NENANA TO YUKON</h4>

<p>No old sites were learned of on this part of the river, and few, if
any, are probably preserved, due to lowness of banks and extensive
destruction (cutting of the banks) by the river.</p>

<p>The present Indian villages on the river are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Nenana (or Tortella), about a mission, half a mile from the
railroad station and town of the same name, on the left bank of
the Tanana and near the mouth of the Nenana River. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>2. "Old Minto," 27 miles from Nenana, right bank; but a small
number of Indians there now.</p>

<p>3. Village at the mouth of the Tolovana, right bank (where the
Tolovana enters the Tanana); the village is on the distal (downstream)
point. Nearly abandoned; only two families there now.
Summer (fishing) camp on the opposite point.</p>

<p>4. A small settlement at mouth of Baker Creek, right bank, about
4 miles upstream from Hot Springs.</p>

<p>5. "Crossjacket village," on left bank, about 45 miles above Tanana,
40 miles below Hot Springs. Used to be called "Cosna."
Occupied, though only a few there.</p>

<p>6. Near 5, but on the opposite bank, a few habitations.</p>

<p>During the open season the Indians live scattered along the river
in fishing camps. This is especially true along the right bank downstream
from Nenana.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Yukon Below Tanana</span></h3>


<h4>BRIEF HISTORY</h4>

<p>The Yukon is the principal river of Alaska. It is one
of the greatest and most scenic rivers in the world. It is approximately
2,300 miles long (from the headwaters of the Lewes
River), in its middle and lower courses ranges at times with its
sloughs to several miles in breadth, and includes many hundreds of
islands of its own formation. Its scenery is still essentially primeval,
affected but little by human occupation or industry. It has, in fact,
gone considerably back in these respects since the gold rush was over.</p>

<p>This great stream has been known to the white man for less than
a century. Cook, in September of 1778, sailed near, discovering
Stuart Island and Cape Stephens of the St. Michael Island, but
missed the river.</p>

<p>In 1829 P. E. Chistiakof, director (1826-1830) of the Russian-American
colonies, sent the naval officer Vasilief to explore the
coasts between the Alexander Redoubt (at the mouth of the Nushagak)
and the Shaktol or Norton Sound, and in 1830 Vasilief explored
the larger part of the Kuskokwim River, of which the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
knew already from their earlier explorers. Here they heard of an
even greater stream to the north.</p>

<p>In 1831, on the recommendation of Vasilief, Michail Dmitrievich
Tebenkof was sent to Norton Sound with the view of further exploration
and the establishing of a post in that region. Tebenkof discovered
that Cape Stephens was not a part of the mainland but of
an island; and he built here a fortified post which in honor of his
patron saint is called St. Michael, a name which subsequently passed
to the whole island. The post was to serve both trade and further
exploration.</p>

<p>From St. Michael, at the end of 1834, a small party is sent out
under the leadership of an educated "kreol" (son of a native mother
and Russian father), Andrei Glazunof, and on January 26, 1835, they
reach the good-sized Indian village of Anvik, on the Kwikhpak, or
Yukon.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> From here Glazunof travels down the river to the large
village of Aninulykhtykh-pak (above Holy Cross), the last Indian
(as distinguished from Eskimo) village down the river, whence
Glazunof sends most of his party back to St. Michael and himself
proceeds to the Kuskokwim.</p>

<p>In 1836 the Russians effect the first settlement on the Yukon, at
Ikogmiut (Zagoskin, 6), later known as the Russian Mission.</p>

<p>In 1838 Malakof, over land portage, reaches Nulato and builds
there a trading post, which, during his absence the next winter, is
burned by the natives. In 1841 Dieriabin rebuilds and fortifies this
post, becomes its headman, and is there eventually (1851) killed by
the Indians.</p>

<p>In 1841 Lieut. Laurenti Alexief Zagoskin is delegated to explore
the "Kwikhpak," with its portages to the Kotzebue Sound, and the
Kuskokwim River; and in 1843 he navigates and maps 600 miles of
the Yukon, or from about the mouth of the Apkhun (northern) pass
to the mouth of the Novitna River, with approximately 100 miles of
each, from their mouth, of the Koyukuk and of the Ittege (or
Innoko) Rivers.</p>

<p>The Russian post at Nulato remains until the sale of their American
dominions by the Russians to the United States in 1867. From it and
from St. Michael individual Russian traders ranged over the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and its lower affluents, but there was no further noteworthy scientific
exploration. In 1863, however, Lukin, who after Vasilief and Kolmakof
helped to explore the Kuskokwim, reached to Fort Yukon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the river has been visited by both the English and
the Americans. In 1847 Mr. Bell, of the Hudson Bay Co., having
heard of the great stream from some of the Indians who visited the
fort on Peels River, set out in quest of it, accompanied by a native
guide, and reached it by the Rat and the Porcupine Rivers.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Between 1843 and 1867 the river in its lower and middle reaches
is freely traversed by the Russian traders. In 1851 Nulato is reached
by Lieutenant Barnard, of H. M. S. <em>Enterprise</em>, in search of Franklin,
only to be massacred there with some of the Russians and natives
by the offended Indians of the Koyukuk. In 1861 Robert Kennicott
traverses a part of the Yukon, and in 1865 he, with Capt. Charles
S. Bulkley, leads there the expedition of the Western Union Telegraph
Co., which is accompanied by William H. Dall and Frederick
Whymper, and results in much information. Already, however, in
1863, Strahan Jones, commander of the Peels River Fort, has descended
the Yukon to the mouth of the Novitna River or the uppermost
point reached by Zagoskin, thus completing its identification
as one and the same great stream. This point and the Tanana mark
the westernmost penetration by the English (the Hudson Bay Co.).</p>

<p>In 1865 begin American explorations proper. In that year, under
an agreement with the Russians, Maj. Robert Kennicott, heading a
party of the Western Union Telegraph explorers, crosses from St.
Michael to Nulato. Kennicott dies in Nulato a year later, but the
explorations are carried on to result eventually in a series of valuable
publications, more particularly by Dall and Whymper.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The researches under the auspices of the Western Union Telegraph
Co., themselves backed by the Government, are followed by explorations
under the direct auspices of the American Government.
Thus, in 1869 there is a reconnaissance of the river by Capt.
C. W. Raymond; in 1883, that by Lieut. Frederick Schwatka; in
1885 by Lieut. Henry T. Allen; in 1898 by Capt. W. P. Richardson;
and these are succeeded by the geological surveys of A. H. Brooks
and companions.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>From 1878 on commenced placer and mining explorations for gold
in Alaska leading gradually to the eventual great gold rush of the
later nineties, which brought a whole flotilla of large river steamers
and other craft to the Yukon and led to a rapid growth of some of
the old and the establishment of a number of new settlements along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>its banks. The rash passed in turn, many of the miners and others
departed, boats became idle and were beached or taken to the St.
Michael ship "bone yard," where, together with most of the buildings,
they are now (1926) being broken up; and the Yukon has
reverted in a large measure to its former primeval, dormant, lonely
state.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the white man's history of the Yukon, with all of
which the river remains but half known, at best. It has never
been fully surveyed, which would be a vast and unending task. It
contains a large number of barely known little tributaries that are
lost in the jungle-covered flats with their many pools and lakes.
It has innumerable islands and channels, in which the traveler is
easily lost, and it cuts and builds constantly during the open season.
Its valley is squally and rainy. The stream may one moment be
like a great, liquid, softly flowing mirror, to be in a few minutes
churned into an ugly and dangerous roughness from which every
smaller boat must seek shelter. Its shores are inhospitable, except
for the native fisherman and hunter, and torment man with swarms
of gnats and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>But there is no malaria; no snakes or other poisonous things. And
when the weather is decent the water, the wooded shores, and the
fresh, clean virginal parklike islands have a greatness and charm
that compensate for much. Besides which there is the still more
intensive allure of original exploration. Botany, zoology, and above
all paleontology, find here still a fruitful field, while for anthropology,
and especially archeology, the land is still largely a terra
incognita.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> There is some confusion about the exact date of Glazunof's journey, partly due perhaps
to the fact that he started on Dec. 30. Wrangell (Stat. and Ethnog. Nachricht., 138)
says that Glazunof's expedition was outfitted the same year (1833) in which the St.
Michael redoubt was established. In Zeleny's abstract of Zagoskin's report (p. 212) and
by Zagoskin himself (pp. 6, 23) the departure of the expedition is put a year later, or
1834, which is probably correct. Dall's remarks (Alaska and Its Resources, 276, 338)
on the subject contain several errors, both of dates and facts. There is also considerable
confusion as to the names Kvikhpak and Yukon. The term Kvikhpak (Kvikh, river; pak,
large) is of Eskimo origin and was applied by these to that part of the river which they
occupied. The name Yukon, or something near this, is of Indian derivation and was
applied to those parts of the river, below Tanana at least, that were peopled by the
Khotana or Indians.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Yukon Natives</span></h3>

<p>Upon their arrival on the Kvikpak and Yukon, the Russians found
the banks of the stream peopled in its upper and middle courses by
Indians and lower down by the Eskimo.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The last Indian village
downstream was Aninulykhtykh-pak, since completely gone. Its
site is identifiable with one that used to exist in front of the present
mission of Holy Cross or just above. The first Eskimo village of
some note was Paimute.</p>

<p>As to the Indians of the Yukon and its tributaries, there is a considerable
confusion of names, almost every author using his own
spelling and subdivisions. It is evident that there were two sets of
names of the various Indian contingents, namely the names, sometimes
contemptuous, given to them by outsiders, and the names in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
use among themselves, which generally meant the people of this or
that locality. The facts are that they all belonged to the Tinné or
Dené family;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that there were two probably related generic names
for them, namely Kutchin (used especially on the upper Yukon) and
Khotana (used mainly along the central and lower parts of the
stream); and that along the Yukon itself, with its channels, there
were three main subdivisions of the people: The Kutchin (with various
qualifications) on the upper parts of the river, down to Fort
Yukon; the Yukonikhotana, from Fort Yukon to Nulato;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and the
Kain (Petrof) or Kaiyuh (Dall) Khotana, or Inkaliks (of the
Russians), from Nulato to Holy Cross.</p>

<p>In addition there were the Tenan-kutchin Tenan-khotana or
Mountain-men of the Tanana; and the Yunnaka-khotana (Zagoskin)
or Koyukuk-khotana (Dall), the people of the Koyukuk.</p>

<p>These groups were settled in a moderate number of permanent or
winter villages along the rivers, in the summer spreading along the
streams in camps. The population found by the first Russian explorer,
Glazunof, from Anvik to Aninulykhtykh-pak, was seemingly
a rather large one. He is reported by Wrangell to have counted, at
Anvik, 240 grown males; at Magimiut, 35; and at Aninulykhtykh-pak
300. At the last-named village in particular there were present
"many people," Glazunof estimating altogether nearly 700. These
figures, except for Magimiut, seem too large and were not even approached
later; but before the next count, that by Zagoskin, all these
settlements had been visited by smallpox; and at the big village
Glazunoff may have seen a potlatch, such as may still yearly be
witnessed at some settlements on the river.</p>

<p>Zagoskin in 1843 made a detailed and evidently reliable count of
all the villages that became known to him. His data in this respect,
as in others, being of fundamental value, are here given, the Eskimo,
for convenience, being included.</p>

the number of the Yukon Eskimo at 1,000 and that of the
Yukon and Koyukuk Indians, from the mouth of the Tanana downward,
at 2,800. Only a few sites of villages are incidentally given
by Dall.</p>

<p>Later demographic records on the Yukon and its tributaries and
on the coast comprise additional data by Petrof, published as a
part of the Eleventh (1890) United States Census and arranged
by districts and linguistic groups; and the data of three subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
United States Censuses, 1900, 1910, and 1920, which are given in differing
ways, but in the main by major ethnic and territorial or
jurisdictional subdivisions.</p>

<p>Due to incomplete enumerations; to the use of native estimates for
actual count (as seems to have been the case with Dall's figures, as
well as others); the different methods and classifications employed;
and the inclusion of units now into one and now into another group
(as with Petrof, who includes three Indian villages below Anvik
among the Eskimo, etc.), the various counts are not comparable and
give but hazy ideas of the true conditions. Yet they are not without
value, particularly in showing the earlier population of the villages
and the relative proportion of the sexes and ages. The more helpful
details are given in the appendix; for still others see references
in bibliography.</p>

<h4>PRESENT CONDITIONS</h4>

<p>To-day, judging from all the obtained evidence, which comprised
information, the witnessing of a potlatch at Tanana at which were
assembled practically all the Indians above Nulato, and a visit below
the Tanana of nearly all the villages where the Indians still live,
the total number of the Tinneh on the lower Tanana (from Fairbanks
to the mouth of the river) and on the Yukon from Tanana
to Anvik, can scarcely be estimated to reach 1,000. It is probably
well below that number. Moreover, not one-half of the adults and
much fewer among the young are still full bloods. Disease, bad
liquor (Yukon), and mostly as yet imperfect accommodation to
changing conditions are steadily diminishing the numbers. Since
our visit many have died from influenza, especially at Anvik. Their
future is not hopeful. On the Tanana, however, and with the more
educated in general, conditions are better, and much good is being
done by the four missions on the two rivers (Nenana, Tanana, Anvik,
and Holy Cross).</p>

<p>The old Indian settlements along the Yukon are gone, with a few
exceptions. On some of the sites, as at Tanana, Nulato, Kaltag, etc.,
there are new villages bearing the old names but built by or in imitation
of whites and sheltering a mixed population. The very names
of not a few of the older Indian sites have gone into oblivion; or
the natives call those they still know by a corruption of a white man's
name, such as "Ulstissen" (for Old Station). Anvik alone has kept
its original site and some of its old character, the mission and the
white trader being across the river.</p>

<p>In the Eskimo part of the Yukon, below Holy Cross, conditions on
the whole appear to be somewhat better. There has also been a
diminution in population. The majority of the old villages have
ceased to exist, while under the influence of whites some new settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ments
or names have appeared. Yet there are respectable remnants
of the Eskimo, and, being better workers than the Indian and seemingly
more coherent, they manage to sustain themselves somewhat
better than he does. Their greatest handicap is disease. The beneficial
effect among them of the old Russian Mission has declined, but
there are a number of Government schools which have a good influence.
They are more tractable, sensible, and in some respects
perhaps more able than the Indians.</p>

<p>But there exists to-day no clear-cut demarcation, geographical,
cultural, or even physical, between the two people. Anvik, the last
Indian village downstream, is in every respect at least as much
Eskimo as Indian; more or less Eskimo-like physiognomies are seen
again and again among the Indians; and Indianlike features are common
among the Eskimo. There has either been an old and considerable
admixture on both sides, or there are some fundamental similarities
of the two groups; perhaps both.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Archeology of the Yukon</span></h3>

<p>Up to 1926 no archeological work had been done along the Yukon
or its tributaries, and barring a few isolated specimens there were no
archeological collections from these regions.</p>

<p>The archeology of the river consists, (1) of the dead but formerly
known villages; (2) of older sites, "dead" and unknown before even
the Russians arrived; and (3) of random stone objects worked by
man that now and then are washed out from the river banks or are
found in working the ground. Except in details conditions are much
alike along the whole river and will best be dealt with as a whole.</p>


<h4>THE RANDOM SPECIMENS</h4>

<p>Wherever the beach of the river shows more or less of stones
that are not talus or just pebbles, there are generally found stones
worked by man. Such localities are scarce. The first exists between
Tanana (the village) and the mission above it. Here specimens are
found occasionally on the beach and occasionally in the soil of the
local gardens. Other such sites were located at Bonasila, below
Anvik, and in four places between Paimute and the Russian Mission.
A few are also present from Marshall seaward.</p>

<p>An examination of the terrain adjacent to such parts of the beach
shows mostly, but not always, traces of an old settlement.</p>

<p>The specimens consist of characteristic axes or adzes, stone scrapers,
hammers, stone knives (along the Eskimo part of the river),
tomahawk heads (probably), objects less well defined, and chips.
There may be semifossilized animal bones, and rarely a bit of char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>coal,
a piece of pottery (for details see Narrative), or an object of
ivory.</p>

<p>The ax proper is peculiar. It is a cupid's-bow ax, double-edged,
and with one or two grooves across its middle. (Pl. 10.) It is as
a rule made of heavy basaltic stone, and its edges are sharpened by
polishing. Rough parts may have been polished also on the body.
Its distal surface is convex (from sharp edge to sharp edge), its
proximal surface straight or mildly convex. I succeeded in getting
a specimen remounted recently by one of the Indians near Tanana.
This form of an ax is still remembered by the old Indians when in
use. They cut trees with it, cutting sidewise and detaching the wood
in splinters. They also remember clubs with stone heads, and told
me they were carried on the back over the right shoulder so as
to be ready for instant and effective use.</p>

<p>These axes have apparently been used by both the Indians and the
Eskimo, but there is an interesting difference. The several specimens
I obtained or saw from Tanana to Ruby were all complete. But
from, about the vicinity of Ruby downstream the bi-edged ax seems
to disappear, or, rather, one-half of it disappears, the butt henceforth
either being left unfinished or one-half of the double ax being
broken off and the remainder being mounted now as an adze on a
shorter handle. This form, and it exclusively, with various secondary
modifications, is found over a wide area among the Eskimo
and may reach into Asia, for I obtained a specimen of it from one
of the Diomede Islands. It connects directly with the Bering Sea
Eskimo ivory adze and chisel. On the other hand the bi-edged ax
appears, in various modifications, to extend widely over Indian
Alaska.</p>

<p>The remaining stone implements need but little mention here.
They will be studied and reported separately by our archeologist.
A special note will, however, be necessary later about the very primitive
stone industry of Bonasila, below Anvik. (See p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>.)</p>

<p>Of pottery I have seen no example above Anvik, but this can
not be taken as evidence of its absence above that point. At Anvik,
Bonasila, and farther down the pottery is like that of the western
Eskimo. It is coarse ware, hand shaped, and of rather poor quality.
It consists of small round bowls to fairly large, more or less conical,
jars. It is never painted but is frequently decorated with thumb
marks and especially with grooves running parallel with the border.</p>

<p>Ivory implements were encountered first at Bonasila and consisted
of a few fine long points barbed on one side, looking like those of
the Eskimo and probably of Eskimo origin. There were also a few
tools of bone, generally scrapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Russian beads, especially those of the large blue variety, are occasionally
encountered, usually singly or in small numbers, especially
in some spots.</p>

<p>A unique archeological specimen from the lower middle portion
of the Yukon Valley is the large stone dish obtained by Mr. Müller,
the trader at Kaltag. (See p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>.)</p>

<p>Besides these random specimens, other cultural objects are found
along the Yukon in connection with old burials. These consist of
an occasional wooden dish, sharpening or polishing stones, rarely a
figurine (doll?) in ivory, Russian snuffboxes, fire sticks, dishes of
birch bark, etc. The cullings in this field are quite poor, but there
has been no excavation of older burials that have been assimilated by
the tundra and lie now in the earth beneath.</p>

<p>The archeology of the old habitation sites, on the other hand,
particularly perhaps on the Shageluk and between Holy Cross and
Marshall, is decidedly promising and invites careful excavation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Location of Villages and Sites on the Yukon</span></h3>

<p>Especial attention was given to the location of the numerous dead
villages and older sites along the Yukon. This task was found, in
most instances, fairly easy with villages that "died" since the
Russo-American occupation, for mostly they still show plain traces
and are generally remembered by the old Indians or even old white
settlers. Their precise allocation on a map, however, is not always
easy or certain. As to the prehistoric sites the search is much more
difficult and depends largely on chance discoveries.</p>

<p>The villages still existing give only a partial clue, in many cases,
to the old, even where these bore the same name, for on occasions a
village changed its location, though remaining in the same general
vicinity and retaining the same name. Thus there existed at different
times apparently, between the earliest contacts with whites and
the present, at least 2 Nuklukhayets, 2 Lowdens, 3 Nulatos, 3 Kaltags,
2 Anviks, etc.; besides which there were differences in recording the
names and changes due to efforts at translation of the native term,
or an application by the whites of a new name, often that of a trader
or settler, to an old site.</p>

<p>In places even late village sites, in others burials, were witnessed
being undermined by the river or the sea. Such sites with their contents
will probably sooner or later be completely lost from this
cause. Many doubtless have thus been lost previously.</p>

<p>The villages and sites located along the Yukon are here enumerated
and as far as possible charted. Information about them was
obtained from the older Indians or river Eskimo and from such
whites as had direct knowledge in that line. Most of these sites were
examined personally, but in some instances this was impossible. The
details concerning those seen will be found in the Narrative, but a
few generalizations may here be useful.</p>

<p>The dead village sites are much alike along the whole river.
They are generally located at the mouth, of some inland stream that
carries clear fresh water, particularly if on the other side there is
the protection of a hill. The dwellings were invariably on a flat
and were throughout semisubterranean and of the same general
type; which applies also to the larger communal houses or
"cashims." The sites can often be told from afar in summer by
the rich grass that covers them.</p>

</div>

<p>The burials were as a rule not far from a village and preferably
on the slopes of the nearest hill. They were mostly above ground,
but under the influence of Russians there were also shallow-ground
burials. The latter can readily be told by the sawed planks of
the coffins and the iron nails by which they are fastened. In
many places no surface burials remain or there are mere traces. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
such, places little mounds may betray old burials assimilated by the
tundra. Trenching in likely spots would doubtless reveal others of
which no trace remains on the surface.</p>

seekers of relics and the curious vandal, who is present on the
Yukon as in other parts of the country.</p>

</div>

<p>As already told in the Narrative, a search for truly ancient sites
along the Yukon has proven largely negative. A more intense and
prolonged archeological survey, with exploratory trenches wherever
there is promise, may one day prove more fruitful. But, as pointed
out before, much can never be expected. Man could at no time
have occupied the Yukon Valley and watershed in large numbers.
He would not have found enough sustenance. Even with fair resources
he would hardly have tarried in these inclement regions as
long as the ways toward the south were open. He never built here
of lasting materials and had little chance to develop or even keep up
any higher culture, and since he is gone the ever-cutting river has
taken away whatever it could reach and scattered it through its
silts and gravels. There is nevertheless a number of small elevated
plateaus along the right bank that ought to be sounded by exploratory
pits or trenches, particularly perhaps where there are traces of
later habitations.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, of course, some sites that are older than others. The
most interesting of these was found at Bonasila, beneath the old
site of Makki or Magimute, 18 miles downstream from Anvik. (See
Narrative.) The main facts concerning this site are as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure_10a.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 10.</span>&mdash;The Yukon from near Marshall to below Kavlingnak</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the above distance from Anvik, on the right bank of the river
and following a wooded hill, is a low flat backed by rising ground
and cut across by a little stream. The flat is narrow, at present about
300 feet; and the part above the stream is deeply pitted by the remains
of semisubterranean houses of a "dead" native village, which
I believe is identifiable with the Magimute of the Russians. On the
slope behind the village were still about a score of old surface burials,
with an article here and there of Russian derivation.</p>

<p>The bank of the flat rises at present only about 4 feet above the
beach of the river, but the flat behind is higher. The bank itself
contains many specimens showing human workmanship, consisting
of objects of stone, birch bark, bone, and rarely also of ivory, besides
many fragments of pottery, many bones of wild Alaskan animals,
and here and there a human skeleton. Some of these objects are low
down in the bank. All the bones from the bank, including the
human, and even the rare points of ivory, are semifossilized; the
stone industry is peculiar; and the human remains differ plainly from
both those of the later Yukon Indian and from those of the Eskimo.
They are apparently Indian (see section on physical characteristics),
but a tall Indian of a type that now is only met with much farther
south.</p>

<p>The stone industry from the bank appeared at first sight so
primitive that even the term "paleolithic" would not fit and the
only term that seemed to meet the situation was "protolithic." It
consists predominantly of scrapers and knockers, with here and there
a tool sharpened for cutting. The scrapers look especially crude.
They consist simply of pieces of smaller or larger andesite-like volcanic
slabs broken to the desired size and chipped more or less
roughly along what was to be the scraping edge. A closer examination
of the stones, which were obtained from a base of a cliff
farther down the river, showed, however, that they were of material
which is hard to work, and that the chipping, under the circumstances,
was not really bad. (Pls. 11, 12.) Pottery must have been
fairly plentiful and quite up to the average of the river, both in make
and decoration.</p>

<p>Two fine long, partly fossilized ivory points picked up formerly
on the site were obtained from Mr. Lawrence. They are handsomely
barbed on one side and show a high grade of skill. They must have
come from the Bering Sea and may belong to the old fine ivory
culture of the western part of that region, of which more later.</p>

<p>There are also some fairly ancient sites farther down the river
(see Narrative), but just what they are and how old remains to be
determined.</p>

<p>A report on the archeological remains from the bank of Bonasila
by Mr. H. W. Krieger, one of the curators of the Department of
Anthropology, United States National Museum, follows:</p>
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>ARCHEOLOGY OF CENTRAL ALASKA</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ancient Stone Culture</span></h3>

<p>"Until the results of Doctor Hrdlička's Alaskan reconnaissance
were first made known to science it had been generally assumed that
Alaskan and Canadian subboreal regions were archeologically barren.
It had been currently accepted that only as one approached
the great river valleys of the Skeena, the Fraser, and the Columbia
could anthropological exploration be conducted to advantage. One
might expect to uncover cemeteries and ancient village sites only
there where a dense and sedentary population had long been established.
Through the discovery of ancient village sites and centers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of population in the lower and middle Yukon River Valley, Doctor
Hrdlička has extended the northern archeological horizon into the
sub-Arctic.</p>

<p>"Of the many sites examined, the old village site at Bonasila, 18
miles below the confluence of the Anvik and Yukon Rivers, yielded
the most interesting data. Crudely flaked implements of trap rock
with cutting edges showing evidence of chipping and grinding were
uncovered. These implements are unique among Alaskan artifacts
and have no relationship with known types of Eskimo or Indian
stonework. In the shaping technic employed by their aboriginal
makers; in form, and in type; and, generally, in their undeveloped
character, the stone artifacts from Bonasila and other ancient archeological
sites on the middle Yukon may be classified as primitive
neolithic.</p>

<p>"The stone implements uncovered at Bonasila are so crudely fashioned
and are apparently of such an improvised nature as to suggest
an extreme conservatism in culture development, or perhaps a
degeneration, due largely to lack of better materials. Due to the
lack of basalt, jadeite, or other hard stone in the valley of the lower
middle Yukon, recourse was had to sandstone and trap rock by the
primitive makers of stone axes and celts.</p>

<p>"Crude pottery vessels and potsherds were discovered associated
with the objects of stone. This ware incorporates elementary decorative
designs distinct from the known historic Eskimo or Indian
types of pottery decoration. There can be no intimation that this
ware is archaic or that it belongs to any archaic culture offshoot
from farther south. It therefore becomes a question of some unknown
earlier Asiatic culture connection that manifested itself in
crude forms of flaked and ground stone implements and in unique
pottery forms. It is uncertain that the ancient fossil ivory culture
of northwest Alaska, of which Doctor Hrdlička has brought in some
excellent examples, is in any manner associated with the primitive
neolithic stone and pottery forms uncovered at Bonasila. It is
established, however, beyond a doubt that both cultures and types of
artifacts are Asiatic in origin and have little or no connection with
the culture of the western Eskimo.</p>

<p>"The Eskimos of the lower Yukon Valley made extensive use of
slate and of jadeite in the production of their polished knives and
celts. Slate knives and polished celts of jadeite are characteristic of
Eskimoan culture throughout the whole of its extent in Alaska.
Each of these materials as well as the finished products shaped from
them were subjects of native barter. Eskimos often undertook long
journeys for their procurement. It is therefore noteworthy that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
single object fashioned from slate or jadeite and but few points of
fossilized ivory were recovered at any of the sites characterized by
the primitive stone culture and pottery of the Bonasila type.</p>

<p>"The most characteristic finds at Bonasila are the crudely flaked
implements of stone, some of which show incipient chipping and
grinding. The coarse type of pottery is unlike that of the modern
Eskimo in tempering, firing, and decorative design.</p>

<p>"The stone culture of the site, although rich in forms, is deficient
in technical development and is scarcely worthy of being classed as
neolithic. There were found in numbers the following types of
artifacts: Circular, discoidal stone pebbles with rim fractures due
to use; river wash pebbles of irregular form used as improvised
scrapers and hammerstones; basaltic, discoidal hammerstones with
abraded edges and pitted at the center; large flake saws of trachyte
(trap rock) triangular in section but provided with sharply
fractured cutting edges; slender flaked fragments of trap rock
tapered to the form of wedges with intentionally worked end sections
and cutting edges; crudely flaked stone knives with evidence of
secondary chipping at cutting edges; other knives of thin slabs of
trap rock with flaked and bilaterally ground beveled cutting edges;
oblong axes of flaked sandstone with hafting notches struck off at
the edges midway from the base; abrading tools of sandstone; celts
of sandstone with ground and beveled working edge and notched
for hafting as an ax; stone scrapers with ground and beveled cutting
edges; fragmentary perforators of stone; re-chipped, flaked
knives shaped by grinding; roughly worked, multiple-grooved
hammers or mauls; and many stone objects unformed and unworked
but classified generally as hammerstones.</p>


<h4>THE POTTERY</h4>

<p>"About a hundred pottery shards and smaller pottery vessels were
recovered from the site at Bonasila. Pottery vessels representative
of the Bonasila culture were shaped out of the solid and show no
trace of coiling. In this respect they conform to the generalized
north Asiatic and Eskimo ware. There is, however, no check stamp
decorative design that is applied with a paddle by the Eskimo nor
evidence that pottery vessels had been built up about a basketry base.
The paste is light buff or gray in color, the buff ware being better
fired and of the same color on the inside, while the gray ware is either
gray or black on the inner surface. A well-defined unfired area covers
one-half of the sectional diameter. Both buff and gray wares show
evidence of better firing than in modern Eskimo pottery. Tempering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
is of coarse fragments of steatite, which is much more durable than
tempering materials such as blood, feathers, and ashes formerly employed
by the primitive Eskimo potter.</p>

<p>"The pottery from Bonasila is utilitarian and consists of shallow
spherical lamps, globose bowls, and cooking pots without feet or
bases. The ware is coarse, side walls and bottom varying from 1 to
2 centimeters in sectional thickness. This type of pottery is practically
duplicated in shards recovered by Doctor Hrdlička from what
is now Eskimo territory in the Yukon Valley near the Russian Mission.
It is probable that further search would bring to light an extensive
region yielding this type of ancient pottery of distinctive
design and unrelated either to Tinné or Eskimo ware.</p>

<p>"Decorative attempts consist of bold incised parallel transverse
lines on the upper sector of the outer surface of the vessel. Deep
corrugations appear on the inside of the rim flare. Both corrugations
and incised line decorations were made with a paddle or wood
splinter shaped for the purpose. Some of the shards have deeply
incised punctations irregularly encircling the outer surface of the
vessel just below the rim extension.</p>

<p>"Shallow spherical pottery lamps accompanied surface burials at
Bonasila. These lamps have a less durable tempering material than
the other pottery fragments recovered. The paste is porous and is
poorly fired. Decorative designs incised on the interior surface of
the lamps are reminiscent of typical Eskimo punctate designs as
traced on the inner circumference of rectilinear or curvilinear etchings
on ivory and bone. It is very probable that these pottery lamps
are of a later date and are of Eskimoan handicraft.</p>


<h4>THE ALASKAN GROOVED STONE AX<br />

[Pl. 10]</h4>

<p>"The grooved stone ax is a typical New World implement. Its distribution
is limited to tribes of the eastern maize area, the Pueblo
tribes of the Southwest, the Athapascans, and the northern woodlands
tribes. Elsewhere in America grooved stone implements of any description
are rare, although not unknown. The groove for the attachment
of cord or sinew binding is common also to the stone adze,
which is characteristic of Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest and
of the Eskimo of Arctic America. The distribution of the stone adze
is more intensive but is much less extensive than is that of the grooved
stone ax and appears to be an environmental form borrowed from
the Arctic tribes by the Indian of southeast Alaska and of British
Columbia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"The double-bitted, multiple-grooved stone ax has two areas of distribution
in North America. One of these is the country of the
northeastern woodlands Indians, extending as far south as the Central
Atlantic States. The other area of distribution is the extreme northwest,
or the mainland of Alaska.</p>

<p>"In the collection brought to the National Museum from Alaska by
Doctor Hrdlička are eight grooved stone implements. All but one
of these have cutting edges for use as axes or adzes. The exception,
Cat. No. 332809, U.S.N.M., is a grooved spherical stone maul or
club 9.5 centimeters (3.7 inches) long and 7.5 centimeters (2.9
inches) in sectional diameter. This grooved object was found near
Tanana on the beach of the Yukon River. Like the grooved stone
axes in Doctor Hrdlička's collection, the groove is incomplete. A
flattened space of approximately 2 centimeters is left un-grooved for
the hafting of a flat surfaced handle end with binding, which is
passed around the transverse groove and then through a hole in the
wooden handle.</p>

<p>"Three single-grooved, double-bitted stone axes were collected from
various points on the Yukon River. These are of interest because
of their similar grooving and double cutting edges. Each is identical
in form, each has been shaped by pecking, except in the sector near
the cutting edges where they have been sharpened and polished by
grinding. Between the raised borders of the centrally pecked groove
and the cutting edges the surface has been shaped to a slight concavity
by pecking. In Cat. No. 332805, U.S.N.M., this concavity
is replaced by a well-defined convex bevel. The pecked groove is
at right angles to the longitudinal axis and is comparatively shallow
but has a wide diameter of 2 centimeters or more. The material is
uniformly of basalt. The axes are 20 centimeters or more long, while
the sectional diameter varies from 6 to 10 centimeters according to
whether the ax is flattened or oval in section.</p>

<p>"Grooved, double-bitted stone axes similar to those collected by
Doctor Hrdlička from the Middle Yukon region have since become
known also from stations farther south in Alaska. One was plowed
up in a field near Matanuska and is now in the chamber of commerce
exhibit at Anchorage, while another was collected in 1927 by the writer
from near Chitna, Alaska. This Alaskan type of grooved ax is
practically identical with that of the central Atlantic seaboard
States, as figured by Walter Hough in the Proceedings of the United
States National Museum, volume 60, article 9, page 14.</p>

<p>"Another grooved type of stone object brought to the National
Museum by Doctor Hrdlička is a stone war club of unusual type.
It was found on the Yukon River beach 1½ miles below the Mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>sion
at Tanana. It is 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) long and is slender,
the maximum sectional diameter being but 3.5 centimeters (1.4
inches). Like the single-grooved axes, it was shaped by pecking,
but much of the surface was also ground. The reverse or hafting
surface is flat; the obverse is convexly tapered to sharp cutting
edges which are at right angles to the haft. The material is basalt.
The hafting grooves, two in number, are comparatively deep and
closely spaced. As to form this stone weapon is unique, appearing,
so far as is known to the writer, nowhere else on the American
Continent. It has been entered on the records of the National
Museum as Cat. No. 332807, U.S.N.M.</p>

<p>"One form of the double-bitted, multiple-grooved stone axes resembles
closely ivory forms made from walrus tusks in the Bering Sea
region. This form also gives evidence of secondary modification,
specimens having been broken intentionally to reduce the tool to a
simple adze. The material is basalt and its range in the north is
limited to the Eskimo area, but becomes widespread to the south in
southeastern Alaska and in British Columbia. The form of this
widely diffused stone adze is approximated in a series of broken
stone axes collected by Doctor Hrdlička. Two such broken and
originally double-bitted axes, Cat. Nos. 332806 and 332810, U.S.N.M.,
were collected from the banks of the Yukon at an old village site
below Anvik. These axes are broken with a crude irregular fracture
just above the upper transverse groove. Another stone ax, Cat.
No. 332812, U.S.N.M., is from Ruby, Alaska, and is practically identical
with the double-bitted but single-grooved stone ax from Tanana.</p>

<p>"It would appear from this brief presentation that there is a remarkable
similarity of form, approaching identity, in the ancient
stone axes from the river valleys of central Alaska. Whether the
particular ax has one cutting edge or is double-bitted; whether it is
provided with one or with two parallel transverse hafting grooves,
the general identity of form remains. The striking thing about the
presence of the double-bitted ax among archeological finds from central
Alaska is that we do not find it represented in such numbers
anywhere until it again reappears in the Atlantic seaboard States.
The very interesting cultural objects discovered by Doctor Hrdlička
and supplemented by my collection in 1927 show that Alaska is far
from sterile or fully known archeologically and make further exploration
both promising and important."</p>

of all the explorers of the river, but they are imperfect and of little
scientific value; the principal ones are given below.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Anthropometric

are a few measurements on two "Yukon Indian" skulls (No. 7530,
and probably No. 7531), and on three crania of the Yukon Eskimo,
by Jeffries Wyman (Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1868, XI, 452); on
one "Ingaleet" and three "Mahlemut" or Norton Sound Eskimo
skulls by George A. Otis (List of Specimens, etc., 35); and on four
skulls collected by Dall, one from Nulato and the rest presumably
from St. Michael, by Hrdlička (Catal. of Crania, p. 30, Nos. 242925,
242899, 242901, 242936).</p>

Zagoskin (pt. II, 61-62): "The Tinneh belong in general to the American family of
redskins, but marked external differences are perceptible in those who are mixed with the
Eskimo. The Tinneh are of medium stature, rather dry but well shaped, with oblong
face, forehead medium, upright, frequently hairy, nose broad and straight, hooked, eyes
black and dark brown, rather large *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* expression intelligent, in those of more
distant tribes somber, roving; lips full, compressed; teeth white, straight; hair straight,
black to dark brown, fairly soft; many of the men hairy over the body and with fairly
thick, short mustache and beard; hands and feet medium, calves small; in general lively,
communicative, cheerful, and very fond of pleasure and song."
</p>
<p>
Dall, William H., Alaska and Its Resources, 53-54: "The Ingaliks are, as a rule, tall,
well made, but slender. They have very long, squarely oval faces, high, prominent cheek
bones, large ears, small mouths, noses, and eyes, and an unusually large lower jaw. The
nose is well formed and aquiline, but small in proportion to the rest of the face. The
hair is long, coarse, and black, and generally parted in the middle. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Their complexion
is an ashy brown, perhaps from dirt in many cases, and they seldom have much
color. On the other hand, the Koyúkuns, with the same high cheek bones and piercing
eyes, have much shorter faces, more roundly oval, of a pale olive hue, and frequently
arched eyebrows and a fine color. They are the most attractive in appearance of the
Indians in this part of the territory, as they are the most untamable. The women especially
are more attractive than those among the Ingaliks, whose square faces and ashy
complexion render the latter very plain, not to say repulsive." (Some of these statements
were evidently somewhat in error.&mdash;A. H.)
</p>
<p>
Schwatka, F. (Milit. Reconn. (1883), Comp. Narr. Explor. Alas., 350): "As regards
these Ingaliks as a class, they are, as a rule, of average height, tolerably well built, but
slender, differing in this respect from the natives farther down the river. They have
long black hair and a complexion brown by nature, but often verging toward black on
account of a liberal covering of dirt."

<p><em>Pure bloods.</em>&mdash;The Yukon Indians are a sparse and largely mixed
population. The mixture is especially evident in the children and
the younger generation. It is mainly that with whites, but in the
lower settlements there is also a good deal of older mixture with the
Eskimo. There is fortunately as yet no Negro admixture.</p>

<p><em>General type.</em>&mdash;The full bloods are typically Indian, though not
of the pronounced plains type. The type is fairly uniform, but there
is not seldom, even up the river, as elsewhere in Alaska, a suggestion
of something Eskimoid in the physiognomy.</p>

<p><em>Color.</em>&mdash;The color in general is near medium brown, ranging to
lighter rather than darker. The hair is the usual full black of the
Indian.</p>

<p><em>Stature and strength.</em>&mdash;- The stature and build are generally near
medium, rather slightly below than above.</p>

<p><em>Head form.</em>&mdash;The head is generally moderately rounded high meso-
to moderately brachycephalic. The face is medium Indian.</p>

<p><em>Body.</em>&mdash;The body proportions seldom impress one with unusual
strength, yet some of the men are by no means weaklings. The most
fitting term by which to characterize conditions in this respect is
again "medium," with an occasional deviation one way or the other.</p>

<p><em>Photographs.</em>&mdash;The accompanying photographs, taken by the
writer from Tanana to Anvik, show a few of the physiognomies.
Some of the girls and women, as well as boys and men, are quite
good looking. (Pls. 13-18.)</p>

<p>From Anvik downward along the river the type of the people
becomes plainly more Eskimoid and on the whole more robust. But
as one can frequently meet farther up the river individuals who
remind one more or less of the Eskimo, so here it is frequent to see
faces that look like Indian. Whether due to old mixture or to other
reason, the fact is that there is no line of somatological demarcation
in the living populations of the river, and the same applies, as will
be seen later, to the skulls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Skeletal Remains of the Yukon</span></h3>

<p>The first Yukon Indian skull measured was that of a half-chief
of the Nulato group, collected in the early sixties by William H.
Dall. There are now three records of this skull, originally and again
now a Smithsonian specimen, one in Wyman ("Observations on
Crania," Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1868, XI, 452, No. 7530), one in
the Otis "Catalogue" (35, No. 259), and one in Hrdlička's "Catalogue
of Human Crania in the United States National Museum
Collections" (p. 30, No. 242925). It is a normal, well-developed
male skull, which gives no suggestion of mixture. The true measurements
of this "type" specimen, taken by present-day instruments
and methods, are as follows:</p>

<p>The skull is seen to be mesocephalic, rather high, and of good
brain capacity; the face is of medium Indian proportions; the orbits
are unequal, rather low; the nose is of medium height and breadth;
the upper dental arch, the basic-facial diameters, and the facial and
alveolar angles, are all near medium Indian.</p>

<p>There was another Indian skull in the five Wyman reported, but
its identity is uncertain. A later collection by Dall included three
Indian female crania from Alaska, but their exact provenience is
uncertain; their measurements are given in my catalogue.</p>

<p>On the 1926 trip I succeeded in collecting directly from the burials
along the lower middle Yukon 17 adult skulls and skeletons. Such
material is both scarce and difficult to obtain, due to the attitude
of the Indians. All the specimens in the collection are from the
Russian times on the river. A few of the skulls show traces of
Eskimoid in their features, but none offer a suspicion of a mixture
with the whites. The measurements are given below. They partly
agree, partly disagree, with those of the Nulato skull. The vault,
the breadth of the nose, the dimensions of the dental arch, are much
alike, but the height of the face, nose, and orbits in the Nulato specimen
is somewhat lower. These may be tribal but also simply individual
differences. We may generalize by stating that the lower
middle Yukon Indian was mesocephalic, with a fairly high vault,
and moderate capacity. The face was of relatively good height but
moderate breadth, resulting in a high upper facial index. Facial
and alveolar prognathism and other features approach the prevalent
Indian medium.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Skeletal Parts</span></h3>

<p>There are seven adult skeletons of males and seven of females. For
present purposes it will suffice to take the males alone and to restrict
consideration to the long bones. The essential data on these are
given on page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>, where they are contrasted with those of North
American Indians in general, and with those of the western Eskimo.</p>

<p>The bones show both relations to as well as differences from the
bones of Indians in general and fair distinctness from those of the
Eskimo.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the long bones of miscellaneous North American
tribes taken together, the Yukon Indian bones show absolutely
slightly shorter humerus (or arm), somewhat shorter radius (or
forearm), a slightly shorter femur (or upper part of the leg), and
a plainly shorter tibia. These Indians had therefore relatively somewhat
shorter forearm and especially the leg below the knees than their
continental cousins. These facts are plainly evident from the radio-humeral
and tibio-femoral indices of the two groups. In this relative
shortness of the distal parts of the limbs the Yukon Indian approaches
the Eskimo, standing near midway between the Indian in
general and the Eskimo. There might be a ready temptation to
attribute this to a mixture with the Eskimo; but an examination of
the records will show that the same condition, so far at least as the
upper limb is concerned (lower?), is already present in the old
Bonasila skeleton, which gives no suggestion of an Eskimo mixture.
It is more likely, therefore, that these are generalized characteristics
of functional origin such as a considerable use of the small canoes.
This view seems to be supported by the relative strength of the bones.
In the Yukon Indian the humerus is stouter, the femur of the same
strength, and the tibia very perceptibly weaker than they are in Indians
in general. In the Eskimo, with even greater dependence on the
canoe, both the humerus and the femur are notably stouter, while
the tibia is weaker, than are similar bones in the Indians in general.</p>

<p>The humero-femoral index in the Yukon Indians is unusually
high, indicating a relative shortness of the femur. This character
is not present in the Eskimo, nor in the continental Indian. It is
probably also of old functional origin, though, this for the present
must remain a mere suggestion.</p>

<p>All of this shows clearly the interest and value of other skeletal
parts than the skull, and particularly of the long bones, for anthropological
studies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Skeletal Remains from the Bank at Bonasila</span></h3>

<p>The skeletal material from the bank at Bonasila consists now of
portions of three adult skulls, one male and two females, and of 13
bones of the male skeleton. All the specimens are more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
stained by manganese and iron and all are distinctly heavier than
normal, showing some grade of fossilization. They closely resemble
in all these respects the numerous animal bones from the bank and
in all differ from the later surface burials of the place.</p>


<h4>THE CRANIA</h4>

<p>The male skull, No. 332513, is represented by the frontal bone
united with a larger part of the face, a separated left temporal, and
the right half of the lower jaw. A large Inca bone, recovered from
the beach a year later, may also belong to the same specimen. The
missing parts are probably still somewhere in the sands of the
beach where there is going on a very instructive scattering and redeposition
on a 4 to 6 feet lower level of the contents of the old bank.</p>

<p>The skull is that of a male of somewhat over 50 years of age, judging
from the moderate to marked wear of the remaining teeth. It is
a normal undeformed specimen, and the same applies to the bones
of the skeleton.</p>

<p><em>Notes and measurements.</em>&mdash;The frontal shows a medium development,
no slope. The supraorbital ridges are rather weakly developed
for a male, leaving the upper borders of the orbits rather sharp.</p>

<p>The skull as a whole was evidently mesocephalic, and neither low
nor very high. The thickness of the frontal is about medium for
an Indian.</p>

<p>The face is of medium proportions and strength, with rather large
orbits, good interorbital breadth, medium malars, medium broad
nose, and but moderate alveolar prognathism. The nasal bridge is
not high, nasal bones fairly broad, spine moderate, lower borders
well defined though not sharp. The sub-malar (canine) fossae are
shallow.</p>

<p>The condyloid process of the lower jaw is high, mandibular notch
deep. The whole jaw is strong but not thick or massive. It is Indianlike,
not Eskimoid, in all its features. The teeth are of good
medium size.</p>

<p><em>Skull No. 333383.</em>&mdash;Of this skull I brought the right parietal with
about one-third of the frontal; Mr. Krieger, a year later, the remainder
of the frontal. Other parts are missing.</p>

<p>The specimen was evidently, a good-size female skull, normal, undeformed,
probably mesocephalic in form, and moderately high. The
thickness of the bones is not above moderate.</p>

<p><em>Skull No. 333950.</em>&mdash;Of the third skull, recovered from the sands
of the beach at low water in 1927 by Mr. Lawrence, there are only
the two parietals. The specimen is that of a young adult female.
The bones, rather submedium in thickness, indicate a skull of slightly
smaller size and slightly shorter than the preceding but of much the
same general type.</p>

<p><em>The skeletal parts of male No. 332513.</em>&mdash;Humeri: The long bones
all give the impression of straightness, length, and of a certain
gracility of form combined with strength, but without massiveness.
The right humerus presents a small but distinct supracondylar process,
a rarity among Indians. The fossae are not perforated. Measurements:</p>

<p>The bone is distinctly platycnaemic, as the femora are platymeric
and the humeri platybrachic, a harmony of characters which is often
met with in the continental Indian.</p>


<h4>ADDITIONAL PARTS</h4>

<p>These include four ribs, the atlas and two lumbar vertebræ. The
first rib approaches the semicircular in type and is rather large,
indicating a spacious chest. Otherwise there is nothing special.</p>

<p>A comparison of the long bones of this interesting skeleton with
those of the later Indians from the same and near-by localities as
well as with those of the western Eskimo (see table, p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>) shows
a number of striking conditions. The length of the bones of the
skeleton is far above the mean of both those of Indians and the
Eskimo, indicating a stature of at least 10 centimeters (4 inches)
higher. In none of their characteristics are the bones near to those
of the Eskimo, making it doubly certain that the subject was not of
that affiliation. Compared with those of the later Indians of the
same territory, the bones show in one line remarkable differences, in
another remarkable likenesses. The differences concern all the relative
proportions of the shafts&mdash;the bones of the old skeleton give
without exception indices that are markedly lower; they are distinctly
more platybrachic, platymeric, and platycnaemic. But the
more basic humero-femoral and radio-humeral indices are practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the same; showing fundamental identity. The humero-femoral
index is especially important in this case. It is exceptionally high in
the Yukon Indians, due to a relatively long humerus, and the same
condition is seen in the old skeleton. It seems safe, therefore, to
conclude that the owner of the old skeleton was not only an Indian
but an Indian of the same physical stock from which were derived
the later Indians of the Yukon; but he was evidently of an earlier
and different tribe or of a purer derivation than those who followed.
To more fully establish and then trace this type, both as to its
derivation and extension, will be tasks of future importance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Yukon Eskimo</span></h3>


<h4>THE LIVING</h4>

<p>As with the Indians farther up the river, the necessities of the
writer's journey did not permit more than visual observations, but
in 1927 Henry B. Collins, jr., succeeded in measuring six adult males
at Marshall.</p>

<p>In general, the people of the Yukon delta and from this to Paimute
are true Eskimo. By this is meant that in the majority of individuals
they can readily be told as a type apart from the Indian and
belonging plainly to that of the extensive family of the Eskimo.
But when the differences are to be defined the task is not easy; some
of the distinguishing marks, though well appreciated, are somewhat
intangible.</p>

<p>The physical differences are essentially those of the physiognomy.
The head is neither narrow nor scaphoid, or even very high. The
Indian face is more prominent and more sculptured; that of the
Eskimo appears fuller, especially in the lower part, and flatter. Part
of this is due to the bony structure, part to the differing amounts
of fat. An eversion of the angles of the lower jaw, which is relatively
frequent and sometimes excessive in the Eskimo male while almost
absent in the Indian, may give the Eskimo face almost a square appearance.
Take with this the seemingly somewhat low Eskimo forehead,
the not very widely open and somewhat on the whole more
slanting eye, and the characteristic Eskimo nose with its rather
narrow and not prominent nasal bridge, the ridiculous monk-like cut
of the hair (in the older males), the often rather full lips with, in
the males, a tuft of sparse mustache above each corner of the mouth;
add to all this a mostly smiling or ready-to-smile "full-moon" expression,
and it would be impossible to take the subject for anything
else than an Eskimo. The Indian's face is more set, less fat, in the
males at least, less broad below, with seemingly a higher forehead,
sensibly made-up hair, not seldom a bit more mustache, and a nose
that generally is both broader and more prominent.</p>

<p>But the differences are less marked in the women and still less so
in the children, especially where similarly combed and clothed. And
there are, particularly on the Yukon, not a few of both Indian and
Eskimo who even an expert is at a loss where to class. They may be
due to old mixtures; no new ones are taking place; but it seems that
there may be present another important factor, that of a far-back
related parentage.</p>

<p>In the color of the skin and eyes, in the color and nature of the
hair, there is no marked difference between the two peoples of the
Yukon. In stature the Eskimos are slightly higher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>


<h4>MEASUREMENTS ON LIVING YUKON ESKIMO</h4>

<p>The exact provenience of the six men measured at Marshall is
uncertain, but they seemingly were all from the lower Yukon and
all were apparently full-blood Eskimo. But the measurements are
rather peculiar. They are given, for comparison, with those of the
western Eskimo in general (p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>). They approach nearest to those
of the Togiak Eskimo, well down below the Kuskokwim. They
show a higher stature than all of their relations farther south, except
the Togiaks, and they have a rounder head. They are, in fact,
moderate brachycephals, a very unexpected form in this strain of
people. The Togiaks also are brachycephalic. The vault is relatively
somewhat higher than it is in the other groups, though the
height is not excessive. The nose is slightly lower as well as narrower
than it is in all the other contingents. The face is close to
those of St. Lawrence Island. The ear is perceptibly smaller and
especially narrower than elsewhere, but perhaps the age factor enters
into the case. The hand is much like that of Togiak and St. Lawrence,
the index being identical.</p>

<p>The brachycephaly of the group for the present is hard to explain.
It can not be ascribed to a mixture with the river Indians, for these,
as has been seen from the skulls, were meso- rather than brachycephalic.
There is need here for further inquiry.</p>


<h4>SKELETAL REMAINS OF YUKON ESKIMO</h4>

<p>As with the Indian, such remains are still rare. Some measurements
of three "Smithsonian Mahlemute" skulls from the Yukon,
collected by William H. Dall, are given by Jeffries Wyman, and
probably the same specimens appear in the Otis Catalogue, the measurements
in which are regrettably not very reliable. These specimens
can not now be located, and the scarce data are of but little
value. The three skulls examined by Wyman were all mesocephalic.</p>

<p>It is now possible to report on 40 adult skulls from the lower
Yukon and the delta. An abstract of the measurements is given in
the next table. The data indicate a considerable local variation.
All the skulls, or very nearly all, are mesocephalic; but they differ
considerably in height and in all the facial features. The Pilot
Station group, from the apex of the delta, and hence the midst of
the Eskimo territory on the Yukon, is especially peculiar. Both the
vault and the face, in the series as a whole, range from low to high,
and much the same is true of the height of the nose and that of the
orbits, while the palate is exceptionally broad, giving a low index,
all of which would seem to indicate instability or conditions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
change, together probably with admixtures from farther up the
river. We need more material, particularly from the stretch of the
river between the apex of the delta and Paimute.</p>

<h4>SKELETAL PARTS OF THE YUKON ESKIMO</h4>

<p>The next table gives the measurements of the long bones in both
sexes in the Yukon Indian (for comparison), in the Yukon Eskimo,
and in the western Eskimo, the latter coming mainly from the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
south of the Yukon and from the Nunivak and St. Lawrence Islands.
The Yukon Eskimo material, collected from intact burials by the
writer, is unfortunately limited to the northern mouth of the river.
The skeletons from St. Lawrence Island were collected on the
Smithsonian expedition to the place in 1912 by Riley D. Moore,
1927 expedition by H. B. Collins, jr., and T. D. Stewart, all of the
National Museum.</p>

<p>The Yukon Eskimo show perceptibly longer bones than do either
the Indians or the southeastern and midwestern Eskimo, indicating
a somewhat taller stature.</p>

<p>The humerus in the males is less broad than either in the Indians
or the midwestern and southwestern Eskimo and has as a consequence
high shaft index; but in the females the index in the Yukon and
western Eskimo series is identical. The radius is relatively even
shorter in the Yukon that it is in the other Eskimo, giving low radio-humeral
index.</p>

<p>The femur is notably less platymeric in the male and slightly less
so in the female Yukon Eskimo than it is in both the Indians and
the rest of the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo, giving a higher
index at the upper flattening. The meaning of these facts is not
obvious and they may undergo some modification with more material.</p>

<p>As to strength, measured by the mean diameter of the shafts, the
Yukon Eskimo in comparison to the southwestern and midwestern
show a slightly weaker humerus, and in the males a slightly weaker
femur at middle, but in the males again, a slightly stronger tibia.
If, however, the mean diameters of the bones are taken in relation
to the length of the bones, then in both sexes and in all the parts the
southwestern and midwestern Eskimo are slightly stronger. This
would seem to indicate more exertion, with harder life, among the
coastal and insular than among the river Eskimo. As a matter of
fact Kotlik and the near-by Pastolik, from which our skeletons came,
were favorably situated at the northern mouth of the river.</p>

<p>The Yukon Eskimo females, as compared with the males, have a
somewhat weaker and especially somewhat flatter humerus, with a
consequently lower shaft index; they have relatively even a shorter
radius, giving a lower radio-humeral index; their humerus itself is
relatively short, giving a lower humero-femoral index; their femur is
relatively somewhat flatter at the upper flattening, giving a lower
index of platymery; while their tibia is relatively less strong antero-posteriorly,
resulting in an index that is more than four points higher
than that of the males.</p>

<h2>NOTES ON THE ARCHEOLOGY OF THE WESTERN
ESKIMO REGION</h2>


<p>Archeological work in the vast area of the western Eskimo is still
in its infancy. Until the 1926 Smithsonian expedition nothing whatever
had been done in this line in the Eskimo parts of the southwestern
coasts of Alaska<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> or on the Kuskokwim or Yukon Rivers.</p>

<p>Some time between 1877 and 1881 E. W. Nelson made limited excavations
on St. Michael Island<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> (see p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>) and also dug on Whale
Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1912 V. Stefánsson excavated at Barrow.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Having two months
to spend at this place he engaged numerous Eskimo of the village and
had them excavate the native village sites in the neighborhood. He
says (p. 388): "It was a small army that turned out to dig wherever
there was a ruin or a kitchen midden, and they worked energetically
and well. While the excavations were not done as methodically and
scientifically as could have been wished, still we were able to get from
them a collection of over 20,000 archaeological specimens within the
space of six weeks. This collection (which is now safely stored in
the American Museum of Natural History) brings out many significant
and some revolutionary ideas with regard to the prehistoric
history of the Eskimo. My method was to dig as much as possible
myself, and to go around as best I could to see the others at work. In
many cases I was able to see the exact position from which the important
finds were taken." The specimens have since in part been
described by Wissler.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Stefánsson brought also some archeological
specimens from Point Hope, where, however, no excavations were
made; and collected a valuable series of crania from Point Barrow.</p>

<p>In 1917-19 excavations near Barrow were conducted by W. B. Van
Valin, leader of the John Wanamaker expedition to northwestern
Alaska, for the University Museum at Philadelphia. The excavations
were made in some mounds located about 8 miles southwest of
Barrow and about 1,000 yards back from the beach on the tundra,
and uncovered six old igloos containing, aside from many cultural
objects, the skeletal remains of 83 individuals. These remains have
since been found to be those of an intrusive group of people and to
be of special interest.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In 1924 Rasmussen during the last parts of his great journey
gathered numerous archeological specimens at Point Hope and from
other localities along the west coasts of Alaska.</p>

<p>In 1926, finally, the year of my survey, some careful initial excavations,
with very interesting results, were carried on at Wales and
on the Little Diomede Island by Dr. D. Jenness, of the National
Museum of Canada, Ottawa. A preliminary report on the results
of this work has been published in the annual report of the National
Museum of Canada for 1926.</p>

<p>Besides such more professional work a good deal of archeological
collection has been done in the regions under consideration by local
people, particularly traders and teachers; and the demand for specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>has made assiduous excavators of some of the Eskimo themselves,
particularly at Point Hope and at St. Lawrence Island.</p>

<p>Beginning with the north, the first white man to be mentioned
in this connection is Charles Brower, the well-known trader at
Barrow. Mr. Brower has not only aided all the explorers who
have reached this northernmost point, but he has also been directly
instrumental in excavating and the making of archeological collections,
though, regrettably, some of these have been scattered.</p>

<p>During 1925-26 there lived at Point Hope a very active and interesting
man, sent there by the Fox Film Co. to photograph the
Eskimo&mdash;Mr. Merle La Voy. La Voy, whom I met at Point Hope
and who for a time became our fellow-passenger on the <em>Bear</em>, had
not only succeeded remarkably in his own line, but had also amassed
during his stay a large archeological collection. He did not excavate
himself, and unfortunately paid no attention to the scientific
side of the case; but by offering the natives sugar, tea, chocolate,
chewing gum, tobacco, etc. in exchange for specimens, he so stimulated
them that they engaged most assiduously in the excavation, or
rather picking over as they thawed, of their old ruins, and brought
him thousands of objects, some of which are of considerable interest.
At the time of my visit there were several barrels full of specimens,
largely of stone and ivory. Skulls and bones, regrettably, were
neglected and reburied in the débris. Later this collection was
transported to San Francisco, where it remains at the date of this
writing, in Mr. La Voy's possession.</p>

<p>At Kotzebue Mr. Tom Berryman, the trader, has made some collections
of Eskimo archeological material, from which I benefited
for the National Museum; and the local teacher, Mr. C. S. Replogle,
informed me that he had a large collection at his home in the States.</p>

<p>At Nome I found a valuable lot of specimens in fossil ivory, pottery,
and stone, in the possession of the well-known Lomen brothers,
members of one of the foremost families in Alaska. The best parts
of this collection I was fortunate to secure for exhibit in the United
States National Museum.</p>

<p>A large and valuable collection of western Eskimo archeological
material was made some years ago by Dr. Daniel Neuman. A part
of this collection is in the museum at Juneau; the whereabouts of
the rest and of Doctor Neuman himself I was unable to discover.
There are several collections of archeological material from the
western Eskimo region at Seattle and San Francisco, but none represents
scientific excavation.</p>

<p>The names of Joe Bernard, Prof. H. N. Sverdrup, and O. W.
Geist should be mentioned in this connection, all having collected
archeological objects in the western Eskimo region. Many speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>mens
of value collected by these men and others are in various
museums or in private hands in Fairbanks, along the west coast or in
Europe.</p>

<p>My own small part in the archeology of Bering Sea and the northwestern
coast of Alaska was, as already stated, mainly that of making
a survey of conditions. The object was to obtain a good general
view of what there was in the line of archeological sites and remains,
and thus help to lay a foundation for more organized research
in the future. In addition all possible effort was made to
collect and obtain specimens of distinct archeological value. Both of
these endeavors met with results of some importance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Old Sites in the Region of the Western Eskimo</span></h3>

<p>The shores of the Alaska rivers, the littoral parts of Alaska, the
more northern Bering Sea islands, and those portions of the Asiatic
coast that were once or are still occupied by the Eskimo, are strewn
with "dead" villages and old sites. Many of these dead villages or
sites are historic, having been abandoned, or very nearly so, since
the coming of the whites; some are older, in instances doubtless considerably
older. Collectively they offer a large, almost wholly virginal
and highly important field to American archeology. They
may contain much of the secrets of Eskimo origin and of his cultural,
as well perhaps as physical, evolution. But these secrets are
not to be given up easily. They are held within a perpetually
frozen ground, which on one hand preserves everything, but on the
other will not yield its contents except to assiduous and prolonged
labor.</p>

<p>Ruined or "dead" villages began to be encountered by the earliest
Russian and other explorers. Beechey (1826) tells us that between
approximately the latitude of Nelson Island and Point Barrow
(60° 34´ to 71° 24´ N.) they noticed 19 (Eskimo) villages, some
of which were very small and consisted only of a few huts, and
others appeared to have been deserted a long time.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Hooper, in 1884, reports Eskimo ruins on the Asiatic side:</p>

<p>"Near the extremity of the cape [Wankarem] we found the ruins
of houses similar to those now in use by the Innuits, half underground,
with frames of the bones of whales. Probably they were
former dwellings of Innuits, who for some reason crossed the
straits and attempted to establish themselves on the Siberian side.
These houses have been found by different travelers at many places
along this coast, and various causes assigned for the abandonment
of the attempt to settle here by the Innuits. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>"At Cape Wankarem and at other places on the Siberian coast we
found the ruins of houses similar to those now in use by the Innuits.
These houses, which have been found by different travelers at many
places along that coast, are not at all like those used by the Tchuktchis,
which, on account of the migratory habits of the reindeer
tribes, are so constructed that they can be taken down and put up
again at will."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Ray and Murdoch both speak of old sites. The very spot they
selected for their observatory at Barrow was one of these. Ray says
of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A point about 12 feet above the sea level, lying between the sea
and a small lagoon three-fourths of a mile northeast from Uglaamie,
was finally selected. The soil was firm and as dry as any unoccupied
place in that vicinity, and as it was marked by mounds of an ancient
village would be free from inundation."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>And farther on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That the ancestors of those people have made it their home for
ages is conclusively shown by the ruins of ancient villages and winter
huts along the seashore and in the interior. On the point where
the station was established were mounds marking the site of three
huts dating back to the time when they had no iron and men 'talked
like dogs'; also at Perigniak a group of mounds mark the site of
an ancient village. It stands in the midst of a marsh; a sinking of
the land causing it to be flooded and consequently abandoned, as
it is their custom to select the high and dry points of land along
the seashore for their permanent villages. The fact of our finding
a pair of wooden goggles 26 feet below the surface of the earth,
in the shaft sunk for earth temperatures, points conclusively to the
great lapse of time since these shores were first peopled by the race
of man."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>The village of Sidaru, southwest of Cape Belcher, which in Ray's
time had a population of about 50, has since gone "dead."</p>

<p>The most direct attention to this subject has been given by Nelson.
In his excellent large memoir on "The Eskimo about Bering
Strait"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> he states as follows:</p>

<p>"Ruins of ancient Eskimo villages are common on the lower Yukon
and thence along the coast line to Point Barrow. On the Siberian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>shore they were seen from East Cape along the Arctic coast to Cape
Wankarem....</p>

<p>"On the shore of the bay on the southern side of St. Michael Island
I dug into an old village site where saucer-shape pits indicated the
places formerly occupied by houses. The village had been burned,
as was evident from the numerous fragments of charred timbers
mixed with the soil. In the few cubic feet of earth turned up at
this place were found a slate fish knife, an ivory spearhead, a doll,
and a toy dish, the latter two cut from bark. The men I had with
me from the village at St. Michael became so alarmed by their superstitious
feelings that I was obliged to give up the idea of getting
further aid from them in this place. I learned afterward that this
village had been built by people from Pastolik, at the mouth of the
Yukon, who went there to fish and to hunt seals before the Russians
came to the country.</p>

<p>"On the highest point of Whale Island, which is a steep islet
just offshore near the present village of St. Michael, were the ruins
of a kashim and of several houses. The St. Michael people told me
that this place was destroyed, long before the Russians came, by a
war party from below the Yukon mouth. The sea has encroached
upon the islet until a portion of the land formerly occupied by the
village has been washed away. The permanently frozen soil at this
place stopped us at the depth of about 2 feet. Here, and at another
ancient Unalit village site which was examined superficially, we
found specimens of bone and ivory carvings which were very ancient,
as many of them crumbled to pieces on being exposed.</p>

<p>"Along the lower Yukon are many indications of villages destroyed
by war parties. According to the old men these parties
came from Askinuk and Kushunuk, near the Kuskokwim, as there
was almost constant warfare between the people of these two sections
before the advent of the Russians.</p>

<p>"Both the fur traders and the Eskimo claim that there are a large
number of house sites on the left bank of the Yukon,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> a few miles
below Ikogmut. This is the village that the Yukon Eskimo say had
35 kashims, and there are many tales relating to the period when it
was occupied. At the time of my Yukon trips this site was heavily
covered with snow, and I could not see it; but it would undoubtedly
well repay thorough excavation during the summer months. One
of the traditions is that this village was built by people from Bristol
Bay, joined by others from Nunivak Island and Kushunuk. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>informant said that a portion of this village was occupied up to
1848, when the last inhabitant died of smallpox, but whether or not
this is true I was unable to learn.</p>

<p>"Another informant told me that near the entrance of Goodnews
Bay, near the mouth of the Kuskokwim, there is a circular pit about
75 feet in diameter, marking the former site of a very large kashim.
A few miles south of Shaktolik, near the head of Norton Sound, I
learned of the existence of a large village site. Both the Eskimo
and the fur traders who told me of this said that the houses had been
those of Shaktolik people, and that some of them must have been
connected by underground passageways, judging from the ditch-like
depressions from one to the other along the surface of the ground.
The Shaktolik men who told me this said that there were many other
old village sites about there and that they were once inhabited by a
race of very small people who have all disappeared.</p>

<p>"From the Malemut of Kotzebue Sound and adjacent region I
learned that there are many old village sites in that district. Many
of these places were destroyed by war parties of Tinné from the
interior, according to the traditions of the present inhabitants.</p>

<p>"On Elephant Point, at the head of the Kotzebue Sound, I saw
the site of an old village, with about 15 pits marking the locations
of the houses. The pits sloped toward the center and showed by their
outlines that the houses had been small and roughly circular, with a
short passageway leading into them, the entire structure having been
partly underground.</p>

<p>"The Eskimo of East Cape, Siberia, said that there were many
old village sites along the coast in that vicinity. These houses had
stone foundations, many of which are still in place. There is a large
ruined village of this kind near the one still occupied on the cape.</p>

<p>"On the extreme point of Cape Wankarem, and at its greatest
elevation, just above the present camp of the Reindeer Chukchi, a
series of three sites of old Eskimo villages were found."</p>

<p>To this, on pages <a href="#Page_269">269</a> et seq., Nelson adds an account of the villages
that "died" on St. Lawrence Island during the winter of 1879-80.
Capt. C. L. Hooper, in the "Cruise of the Corwin in 1881, Notes
and Observations" (published in Washington, 1884, p. 100) gives the
date as 1878-79, and adds further details about these villages.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Present Location of Archeological Sites</span></h3>

<p>Through personal visits, wherever possible, and through information
from all available sources, an effort was made to locate and
learn the character of as many of the old sites as could be traced. In
this endeavor I was aided by many whose services are hereby gratefully
acknowledged. Especial thanks are due to Captain Cochran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
with the officers and men of the <em>Bear</em>, particularly Boatswain H.
Berg; to the Lomen brothers and their esteemed father, at Nome;
to Father B. La Fortune and the Reverend Baldwin at Nome; to
Mr. Sylvester Chance, superintendent of the northwestern district,
Bureau of Education; to Mr. Charles D. Brower, trader at Barrow;
to Mr. Jim Allen, trader at Wainwright; and to Dr. E. P. Walker,
head of the Biological Survey of Alaska. The list to follow, supplemented
by maps, will give in brief the name, location, and description
of the remains.</p>

<p>The old sites occur, (1) in the form of refuse heaps; (2) as late
village sites, smaller or larger areas of ground covered with mostly
circular elevations and depressions, with occasionally the wooden remains
of igloos or kashims, or only partly ruined dwellings; such
remains are the most common; (3) as old village sites in the form of
a long irregular ridge mound or of more or less separate heaps;
(4) as heaps or "mounds" of individual structures. And as
"passed" sites, covered completely by sand or silt and unknown until
uncovered through the washing away by the sea or rivers of some of
the deposits.</p>

<p>In addition there are the remains of burial grounds which are
occasionally marked by small low mounds or hummocks produced by
decayed burials that have been more or less assimilated by the tundra.
Stony beaches with chips, implements, etc., such as are found off old
sites on the Yukon, have not been seen in the region now dealt with
in any instance.</p>

<p>The ruined dwellings and communal houses throughout this region,
with a few minor exceptions, were of one general type. They were
circular, yurta-shaped, semisubterranean structures, with a more or
less subterranean tunnel approach, built of hewn driftwood and
earth. These dwellings, when the wood decays and the dome falls
in, leave characteristic saucer-and-handle-like depressions. But
where such dwellings were close, and especially where they were
heaped up or superimposed on older ones, the remains, together with
the refuse, may form an irregular elevated ridge or a large irregular
mound.</p>

<p>On the Diomede Islands the dwellings are built of stone, and ruins
of stone houses have been reported to me from inland of the westernmost
parts of the Seward Peninsula. Stone dwellings were also
known on Norton Sound.</p>

<p>Some of the ridges and heaps, as at Shishmaref, Point Hope, one
of the Punuk Islands, etc., are large and may be up to 15 feet and over
in depth, but mostly the remains are of moderate to small size. The
latter sometimes could easily be confounded with natural formations.
The older remains may superficially be indistinguishable even to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
experienced observer; and if there is anything still more ancient, it
lies somewhere in the old sands and beaches where, except through
some fortunate accident, it can not be discovered. Except for their
surface, the remains are generally frozen hard, and no excavation is
possible except through gradual exposure and the melting of layer
after layer by the warmth of the sun or a melting of the ground
with water or by some other artificial means.</p>

<p>Some at least of these ruins are rich archeologically. They greatly
exceed in this respect a large majority of village ruins and mounds
in the interior of the continent. This appears from their gradual
excavation by the natives at Barrow, Point Hope, St. Lawrence
Island, and elsewhere. The natives have now for many years been
selling thousands of articles thus obtained to traders, teachers, and
crews of visiting vessels. A regular and growing trade detrimental
to archeology is now being carried on in "fossil ivory," which generally
consists of pieces showing human workmanship and occasionally
includes specimens of rare beauty and importance.</p>

<p>The archeological contents of such old sites as that near Savonga
on the St. Lawrence Island, or those at Wales, Point Hope, Barrow,
etc., are varied, and in instances exceedingly interesting. They comprise
a large variety of objects of stone, ivory, bone, and wood, while
in the more superficial layers are also found occasionally glass beads
or objects of metal. Some ruins, such as those at Point Hope and
Kotzebue, are very rich in stone objects; others, as those at the St.
Lawrence Island, are rich in articles of ivory and bone. Pottery is
generally scarce. Articles of stone comprise mainly points, knives,
adzes, and lamps; those of wood, goggles and masks; of bone, various
parts of sleds, a large assortment of snow and meat picks, and scrapers;
of ivory, barbed points, harpoons, and lance heads, and a large
variety of tools, fetishes, and ceremonial objects; of clay, a few dishes
and pots for culinary purposes. Traces of objects made of whalebone
or even birch bark may also appear.</p>

<p>The stones used were mainly slate and flint, but there may also
be met with quartz, quartzite, and especially the Kobuk "jade."
The workmanship is as a rule good to excellent. The arrow points
show a number of interesting, not yet fully known, types, the long
blade with parallel sides predominating. The stone lamps and rare
dishes also need further study. The knives all approach the Asiatic
semilunar variety.</p>

<p>The bones and wooden objects and the pottery from this region
are fairly well covered by the writings of Ray, Murdoch, Nelson,
Rau, Thomas, and others; the masks need further study.</p>

<p>The most interesting archeological specimens from the region of
the western Eskimo, however, are some of those in "fossil ivory,"
the term being applied to walrus ivory that through long lying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the ground has assumed more or less of a pearly yellow, variegated,
sepia-brown or black color. These objects are known as yet very
imperfectly. They are scarce at and especially north of Point Hope,
and again along the west coast south of Norton Sound. Their center
of frequency comprises seemingly the St. Lawrence Island, some
parts of the Asiatic coast, the Diomedes, and parts of the Seward
Peninsula. But they occur at least up to Point Hope, while west
of Bering Strait they are said to appear as far as the river Kolyma.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/figure_12a.jpg" width="520" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 12.</span>&mdash;Conventionalized design from
fossil ivory specimen shown in Plate 19</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the objects in fossilized ivory show the well-known Eskimo
art, with geometrical design. But besides these there occur here and
there beautiful specimens, harpoon
heads, figures, needle cases,
etc., which are of the finest workmanship
and which both in form
and design differ from the prevailing
Eskimo types. They are
examples of high aboriginal art;
and their engraved decorative
lines are not geometrical but
beautifully curvilinear. (Fig.
12.) The accompanying illustrations
of specimens I succeeded in
obtaining from different sources
will show the nature of this art.
(Pls. 19-26.) Isolated specimens
of this nature have been secured
before by Nelson, Neuman, Sverdrup,
Stefánsson, and others.
Jenness in 1926 dug out a few
from the old sites at Wales.
There are several in the Museum
of the American Indian in New York. But the largest and best
collection of these remarkable articles is now that of the United
States National Museum.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The large fossil ivory figure (20.3 cm. maximum length, pl. 26)
collected by Mr. Carl Lomen and now in the National Museum is of
special interest. It comes from the Asiatic side. It is a handsomely
made piece, belonging in all probability to the high fossil ivory
culture. Its peculiarity is the bi-bevel face, a face made by two
planes rising to a median ridge. It is so far a unique specimen of
its kind. But with the aid of Mr. H. W. Krieger, curator of
ethnology, United States National Museum, we found similar bi-beveled
faces in wooden figures from northeast Asia, in wooden
Eskimo masks from the Yukon, and in wooden ceremonial figures
from Panama. The latter are shown herewith. (Pl. 27.) The
whole presents evidently a nice problem for the archeologist and
student of culture.</p>

<p>I had further the good fortune to secure, through the kindness of
Reverend Baldwin, two handsome and remarkable knives from
fossil mammoth ivory. These knives were said to have been made
recently by the Eskimo of the Seward Peninsula. They are shown in
Plate 28. They each bear on the handle a nicely carved crouching
animal figure. With them are shown, somewhat more reduced, two
probably ceremonial knives from Old Mexico; and also the handle
of a late palaeolithic poignard from France, illustrated by De
Quatrefages.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Regarding the latter form we read the following in
Mortillet:<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> "D'autres poignées de poignard, faites dans des données
pratiques et artistiques analogues, ont été recueillies dans diverses
collections. Les plus remarquables sont deux poignées en ivoire
trouvées par Peccadeau de l'Isle, à Bruniquel. L'une se rattachait à
la lame, comme dans la pièce précédente, par le train de derrière;
l'autre, au contraire, par la tête." Knives with similar crouching
animal figures on the handle are being made by the King Islanders.</p>

<p>Here, evidently, is one more interesting problem for the archeologists.</p>

<p>The art shown by these objects, the conventionalization, and
especially the decorations, appear to show affinity on one hand to
deeper eastern Asia and on the other to those of the American northwest
coast and even lower. This may prove to mean much or little.
The fact that these specimens establish beyond question is that at one
time and up to a few hundreds of years ago there existed in the lands
of the northern Bering Sea native art superior to that existing
there later and at the present, and comparable with the best native
Siberian or American.</p>

<p>The meaning of this fact seems to me to be of importance. The
evidence suggests, aside from other things, that American cultural
developments may after all not have been purely local or even
American, but that they may, in part at least, have been initiated or
carried from Asia. In view of these and other recent developments
it seems rational to consider that America may have been peopled
by far eastern Asiatic groups that not merely carried with them
differences in language and physique but also in some cases relatively
high cultural developments. But these for the present are mere
hypotheses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no definite indication as yet that the people of the high
fossil ivory art in the northern Bering Sea and neighboring parts
were any others than the ancestors of the Eskimo. The skeletal remains
from these regions, as will be shown later, rather support
this view. But those ancestors may not yet have represented the
characteristic present type of the people. Here, too, nothing definite
can be said before the results of sufficient scientific excavations
become available.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sites and Villages</span></h3>

<p>The location of the western Eskimo villages has received more or
less attention by most of the explorers in their region from the
Russian time onward; but such efforts are generally limited to the
living villages in the area visited by the observers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest Russian map of value in this connection on
the Bering Sea region is that which I find in Billings and Gall's
Voyage or "Putěshestvie" of 1791, printed in St. Petersburg 1811.
The map bears no date, but is evidently quite early. It gives three
villages on the western point and north coast of the Seward Peninsula,
namely Kiemile (later Nykhta, now Wales), Chegliukh, and
Tykiak. (Pl. 29.)</p>

<p>The most notable and valuable of the Russian contributions to this
subject is that of Zagoskin. This refers to the period of 1842-1844
and is contained partly in his "Peshechodnaia Opis," etc. (St.
Petersburg, 1847), but especially on his maps. There are, I find,
two of these maps&mdash;the "Merkatorskaia Karta Časti Sieverozapadnago
Berega Ameriky" and the "Merkatorskaia Generalnaia Karta
Časti Rossijskich Vladěnii v Amerikě." I came across the first in
one copy of Zagoskin's invaluable account, which should long ago
have been translated into English, and the other in another copy.
Part of the second is here reproduced. (Pl. 30.) Both bear the
statement that they were made by Zagoskin as the result of his explorations
on the Yukon in 1842-1844. The second ("general") map
is much the clearer and richer. Both maps, but especially the second,
give a good number of villages, especially about Norton Sound and
along the southern shore of Seward Peninsula. The orthography
differs somewhat on the two charts.</p>

<p>The Tebenkof Atlas of 1849 includes a remarkably good map of the
St. Lawrence Island. As on other Russian maps it gives the Punuk
Islands, that later are lost by most map makers, and indicates the
location of what probably were all the living settlements of that
time, except on the Punuk. (Fig. 27.)</p>

<p>Finally, in 1861, Tikhmenief, in his "Istoričeskoie Obozrenie"
(history of Russian America) gives a detailed map with many locations
of Eskimo villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The Aleutian Islands and Kodiak are excellently dealt with by
Veniaminof and also Tikhmenief, though little special attention is
given to the location of the settlements.</p>

<p>None of the Russian explorers, regrettably, report verbally on the
deserted sites or ruins. But their registration and location of many
villages that have since become "dead" is of much historical as
well as anthropological value.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 13.</span>&mdash;World map</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of later and particularly American authors who gave attention to
the location of the western Eskimo settlements, the foremost is E. W.
Nelson. Beginning in 1877 with the St. Michael Island and ending
with the cruise of the <em>Corwin</em> in 1881, Nelson made trips down the
coast to the Kuskokwim, up the Yukon to Anvik, over the Bering
Sea, the St. Lawrence Island and parts of the Chukchee Peninsula,
and finally, with the <em>Corwin</em>, along the northern coasts to Point Barrow.
And these journeys were devoted largely to biological and
ethnological observations and collections, the latter including the
location of the western Eskimo habitations of that time. His locations
are given on the accompanying map (fig. 15) taken from his
classic memoir, "The Eskimo about Bering Strait," published in 1900
in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
This memoir contains a section of "Ruins" (pp. 263-266), a
brief account of the recently dead villages on St. Lawrence Island
(p. <a href="#Page_269">269</a>), and an instructive section on Eskimo burials (pp. <a href="#Page_310">310</a>-322).
Nelson brought also the first more substantial collection of Eskimo
crania.</p>

<p>The next deserving man in these connections is Ivan Petrof. Of
Russian-American extraction, Petrof was charged in 1880 with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
census enumeration of the natives in Alaska, and he later published<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
a valuable report on his work, together with detailed demographic
data and a map on which are given all the living settlements of his
time. Nelson's map is partly based on Petrof's data.</p>

<p>Since Nelson and Petrof but little has been done in this field.
But the maps of these two observers have been utilized more or less
by the map makers of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
the Geological Survey, and other Government agencies concerned
with Alaska. The result is that some of these charts are exceptionally
useful to the anthropological explorer in Alaska; nevertheless
the data they carry are incomplete and the locations or names
are not always exact, a good many of the villages shown are now
dead, and old ruins, as usual, have received no attention.</p>

<p>A very valuable supplement to all the maps has in 1902 been
published by the United States Geological Survey. It is the
Geographic Dictionary of Alaska, by Marcus Baker. This
volume, besides brief but serviceable historical data, gives in
alphabetical order nearly all the then-known names of localities in
Alaska, including those of the Eskimo and Indian settlements; and
each name is accompanied by brief but in many instances most
helpful information. This highly deserving volume, indispensable
to every student of Alaska, has for many years been out of print,
but it is understood that a new revised edition is slowly being
prepared.</p>

<p>The object of the following notes and data is some measure of
usefulness to future anthropological and archeological workers in
Alaska. They are surely incomplete and very imperfect, yet they
may be of some service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Archeological and anthropological research in the highly important
western Eskimo region is bound to develop in a not far distant
future; for this is the region through which in all probability
America was peopled. It is this region that promises to solve the
problem of the antiquity of the Eskimo and may throw much light
upon the origin of these people, and one that, as shown, above, has
begun to reveal highly interesting old cultural conditions. And it
is a region in which destruction of the remains by nature, but most
so recently by the natives themselves, proceeds at an alarming pace.</p>

<p>The information on which these notes and the accompanying
charts are based has been obtained largely from the Russian and
other maps, from local traders, teachers, missionaries, and natives,
and from a few explorers.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Only in a minority of cases was it
possible to visit the places in person; to have visited all would have
been a task of pleasure, but would have required a staunch boat of
my own and at least three full seasons.</p>

<p>Many of the sites to be given are now "dead" and there may be
several old sites in the vicinity of a living village. Others combine
ruins with present habitations. Still others are partly or even wholly
abandoned a part of the year when the inhabitants go camping or
hunting, and are partly or wholly occupied during the rest of the
year. Finally, there are some new settlements, with modern dwellings
and ways, and their number will increase, the Eskimo taking
kindly to civilization and individual property.</p>

<p>The data to be given here are limited to the Eskimo territory
in southwestern and western Alaska, leaving out those in Siberia
where much is uncertain. Due to the uncertainties of the Prince
William Sound region they will begin with Kodiak Island. There
are also on hand, principally due to Dr. E. P. Walker, numerous
locations of old sites and villages in the Indian parts of southern
and southeastern Alaska, but these will best be reserved for another
occasion.</p>

<p>The Eskimo area will be roughly seen from the accompanying map
published on the basis of the enumeration by the Fourteenth United
States Census of 1920. A very great part of the territory allotted
to the Eskimo, as well as that of the Indian, is barren of any population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
or its traces; the divisions represent the hunting grounds or
grounds claimed by each people, not an occupied territory. The data
will be given in south-to-north order.</p>

<p>Nearly all the settlements in these regions are now, and have
evidently always been, on the shores of the seas and bays, as close
to the water as safety would permit. A few villages and sites occur
also, however, on inland lakes and rivers. The favored locations
have been an elevated flat near the mouth of a fresh-water stream
or the outlet of a lagoon, a sufficiently elevated spit projecting into
the sea, or an elevated bar between the sea and an inland lake. The
essentials were an elevated flat, a supply of fresh drinking water,
and a location favorable for fishing and hunting; if there was some
natural protection, so much the better. There were no inland settlements
except on the lakes and rivers. In a few cases, as at the
Kings and the Little Diomede Islands, very difficult locations were
occupied only because outweighed by other advantages.</p>

<p>Caves throughout the occupied region north of the Aleutian chain
are absent, and there was therefore no cave habitation.</p>

<p>None of the settlements were very large, though a few were much
larger than others. They ranged from one or two family camps
or houses to villages of some hundreds of inhabitants. A large majority
of the settlements had from but two or three to approximately
a dozen families.</p>

<p>There were two main types of dwellings, the semisubterranean
sod houses for the winter and the skin tents for summer. In some
places the two were near each other; in others the summer dwellings
were in another and at times fairly distant locality.</p>

<p>The "zimniki" (in Russian) or winter houses were throughout
the region of one general type. They were fair-sized circular semisubterranean
houses, made of driftwood and earth, and provided
with a semisubterranean entrance vestibule. Their remains are characterized
everywhere by a circular pit with a short straight trench
depression, the same pot-and-handle type as found along the Yukon.
Rarely for the construction of the houses, where driftwood did
not suffice, recourse was had to whale ribs and mandibles. The
"letniki," or summer houses, were constructed on the surface of
wood, sod and skins, or of whale ribs and skins, approaching on one
hand the summer huts of various continental tribes and on the other
the "yurts" of the north Asiatic peoples. The "kashims," or communal
houses, were built, much as on the Yukon, like the family
dwellings, but occasionally quadrilateral and much larger. Smaller
semisubterranean storage houses of driftwood and sod near the
winter dwellings were seemingly general.</p>

<p>Ruins of stone dwellings, without mortar, are said to exist in
places on Norton Sound and Bay and on a lagoon near the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
end of the Seward Peninsula. The few houses on the Little Diomede
are made of loose unhewn stone slabs. The dwellings of the King
Islanders are built on the rocky slope of the island on platforms supported
by poles, all of driftwood.</p>

<p>There is as a rule an absence of separate refuse heaps near the
villages. The refuse apparently has been dumped about and between
the houses rather than on separate piles.</p>

<p>Dead villages abound. On consulting the older Russian records,
however, it is seen that nearly all were still "living" as late as the
early forties of the last century. Yet there are sites that were
"dead" already when the Russians came, and the accumulations in
other cases denotes a long occupation.</p>

<p>The site of a dead village, in summer, is generally marked by
richer and greener vegetation; same as on the Yukon. The site
itself is usually pitted or humped in a line forming a more or less
elevated ridge, or the pits may be disseminated without apparently
much order. And there may be irregular mound-like heaps without
external traces of any structure.</p>

<p>In the older sites no trace of wood is visible; in the later rotten
posts, crosspieces, parts of the covering of the house or tunnel, or even
a whole habitation may be present. In the old sites the wood is
hewn with stone axes; in the later it is sawed, and there may be nails.</p>

<p>Older accumulations lie occasionally beneath more recent ones,
though no interruption of continuity may be traceable. Of a superposition
of villages no trace was observable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Burial Grounds</span></h3>

<p>Due to the impossibility of digging sufficiently deep into the frozen
ground the western Eskimo buried their dead near or on the surface
or among rocks. Occasionally they utilized also, it seems, old dwellings
for this purpose, and in more recent times at least the surface
burials, wherever there was driftwood, would be protected by heavy
rough-hewn planks put together in the form of boxes or by driftwood.
They bear close fundamental resemblance to those of the
Yukon. On the Nunivak Island occur graves made of rough stone
slabs piled up without much order. (Pl. 31, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>.)</p>

<p>Throughout the region the burials were located near the village,
but the distance varied according to local conditions and habits. In
some of the Eskimo villages of the lower Yukon, as at Old Hamilton,
some burials were close to the houses of the living. In the Bering
and Arctic regions the burial grounds, though sometimes of necessity
not far from the houses, as at the Little Diomede, in other places,
as at Point Hope and Barrow, were at a distance extending to beyond
a mile and a half from the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>As a rule the wood of burials older than about 80 years was found
fully decayed with the bones secondarily buried. Of earlier burials
there is generally no trace on the surface, but on excavation skeletal
remains are found at various depths below the surface. These characteristic
self-burials, or rather tundra burials, may prove of much
importance to anthropology in the future. As outlined before (see
Narrative, pp. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>, <a href="#Page_79">79</a>) the process is a decay of the wood; the sagging
down of the bones, covered more or less by the decayed material; an
encroachment of moss or other vegetation on the little mound thus
produced; and gradual accumulation through wind or water carried
materials of more covering over the bones, until the mound disappears
and the remains, generally still in good condition, are buried
as if intentionally inhumed.</p>

<p>The Eskimo everywhere were found to be exceedingly sensible
about the older, and even recent, skeletal remains, and assisted readily
in their collection, as well as in excavation, offering thus the best
possible conditions for anthropological and archeological work in
these regions.</p>

<p>The notes, charts, and a detailed list of the sites and villages follow.
In numerous cases it was found impossible to say whether a
site was completely "dead" or still occasionally partly occupied, so
that distinctive markings had to be abandoned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, Alaska Peninsula</span></h3>

<p>Very largely still a terra incognita for anthropology and archeology.
Partly occupied by Indians (Prince William Sound, Kodiak
Island?), partly by mix-blood Aleut (parts of Peninsula, and of
Kodiak), partly by Eskimo. There is but little skeletal or archeological
material from the whole extensive territory.</p>


<h4>KODIAK ISLAND AND NEIGHBORHOOD<br />

[<span class="smcap">Fig. 17</span>]</h4>

<p>1. <em>Litnik</em> (probably the Russian "Lietnik," the name for a summer
village).&mdash;Indian village on Afognak Bay, Afognak Island.
This name is found on a map made by the Fish Commission in 1889.
Apparently it is the Afognak of other maps (G. D. A.).<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>2. <em>Afognak.</em>&mdash;On the southwestern part of Afognak Island. Village
or row of scattered dwellings on shore of Afognak Bay, in
southwestern part of Afognak Island. Population in 1890, 409.
(G. D. A.) According to Walker, "an important, occupied native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
village which has probably been occupied for a long time. No doubt
there are other native villages in this immediate vicinity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>6. <em>Nunamiut.</em>&mdash;Native village, on the shore of Three Saints Harbor,
Kodiak. (G. D. A.) Better known locally as Three Saints
Bay. There was formerly an old native and Russian settlement at
this point and vicinity, and fishing operations are frequently now
conducted here. (E. P. W.)</p>

<p>7. <em>Kaguyak.</em>&mdash;Village, at Kaguyak Bay, on the southwestern shore
of Kodiak. It may be identical with the Kaniag-miut of the Russian-American
Co., in 1849. (G. D. A.) An old native village at
present occupied by only one or two families. Possibly an old
site. (E. P. W.)</p>

Population in 1890, 106. (G. D. A.) An occupied native village
consisting of about a dozen houses, but which has probably been
occupied for a long time. (E. P. W.)</p>

<p>9. <em>Akhiok.</em>&mdash;Native village on the northern shore of Alitak Bay,
Kodiak. Native name from Petrof, 1880. Apparently identical
with Oohaiack of Lisianski in 1805. (G. D. A.) An occupied native
village consisting of about a couple of dozen houses. This or possibly
other villages in the vicinity have undoubtedly been occupied
for a long time. It is possible that there was a native settlement at
Lazy Bay near this point, for Lazy Bay was formerly a native headquarters
for sea otter hunting. (E. P. W.)</p>

<p>10. <em>Karluk.</em>&mdash;Village at mouth of Karluk River, Kodiak. Native
name from the Russians. (G. D. A.)</p>

<p>11. <em>Uyak.</em>&mdash;Bay indenting the northwestern coast of Kodiak; also
a village. Native name from the Russians. Lisianski, 1805, spells it
Oohiack and the village Ooiatsk. Petrof, 1880, writes it Ooiak. Has
also been written Uiak. (G. D. A.)</p>

<p>12. <em>Larsen Bay.</em>&mdash;A cannery has been located at this point for a
number of years, and there is an old native trail from Larsen Bay
to Karluk River, so presumably natives have frequented this section
and no doubt have at some time had settlements there. Definite
information regarding this is not available. (E. P. W.)</p>

<p>13. <em>Uganik.</em>&mdash;Native village at head of Uganik Bay. Shown by
Lisianski, 1805, who spells it Oohanick. (G. D. A.) An occupied
native village and one which has apparently been in use for a considerable
period. (E. P. W.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bristol Bay to Cape Romanzof</span></h3>

<p>From the northern part of Bristol Bay to Cape Romanzof a
partial survey of the coast was made in 1927 by Collins and Stewart
(U. S. National Museum Expedition). In these regions and on
the Nunivak Island it was possible to locate a series of villages
some of which are still "living," others in ruins. In the late
seventies of the last century, as stated before, the coast between
Kuskokwim Bay and St. Michael Island was visited and its villages
recorded by Nelson. A detailed archeological survey of this coast
remains for the future. Doctor Romig, formerly a medical missionary
at Bethel, told me of a number of old sites on the river.
Some notes of interest by T. D. Stewart are given in the details.
Mr. F. W. Bundy, for a time my companion on the <em>Bear</em>, told of
an old site on the Kuskokwim. In March, 1927, H. W. Averill,
writing from Bethel, tells of a deep-lying old site on the southern
coast of the Kuskokwim Bay. (See details.) And later the same
year Father Philip I. Delon, of the Holy Cross Mission, sent in
three skulls from Kashunuk, in the Yukon delta, with information
of much additional material in that locality.</p>

River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>53. <em>Arolik.</em>&mdash;A village. H. W. Averill of Bethel writes me under
date of March 3, 1927, as follows: "I am sending you some old stone
pieces that came from the Aralic River, a tributary of the lower
Kuskokwim River, that were washed up by a bend in the river from
an old village that is now 6 feet underground."</p>

the old Eskimo village Mumtrelega.</p>

<p>59. <em>Napaiskak.</em>&mdash;Eskimo village on the left bank of the Kuskokwim,
about 4 miles below Bethel. According to Nelson, 1878-79, its
native name is Napaskiagamute, and according to Missionary Kilbuck,
1898, it is Napaiskagamut; i. e., Napaiskak people.</p>

<p>60. <em>Old sites.</em>&mdash;Mr. Bundy, my companion for a time on the <em>Bear</em>,
gives the following details: "Specimens found about 12 miles below
Bethel, Alaska, at the mouth of the Kuskokwim River, beneath
about 10 or 12 feet of alluvial soil deposits of sand and clay.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jack Heron, of Bethel, first noted the presence of old implements,
and upon returning with him about August 1, 1923, we
found the river had cut into the bank quite a bit and had brought to
view, after the high waters had receded, additional specimens.</p>

<p>"Those found included: A large copper kettle of perhaps 8 gallons
capacity of early Russian pattern, several arrowheads of slate
or dark gray flint, and two spearheads of bone with several broken

<h3><span class="smcap">Cape Romanzof to Northern (Apoon) Pass of the Yukon and
Northward</span></h3>

<p>On this coast there is little information since the time of Nelson.
There are a number of occupied villages as well as of old sites. The
region is bleak and the Eskimo there are reported to live miserably.</p>

<p>The principal Eskimo villages and sites along the lowermost
branch of the Yukon have been given previously. (Fig. 11.)</p>

<p>From the northernmost pass of the Yukon to St. Michael Island
the coast is poor in Eskimo remains. A site of interest here is the
old camping ground, with a few permanent houses, of Pastolik, and
there are two small sites farther up the coast. Pastolik to the
writer's visit was still occasionally occupied by a few Eskimo families.
There are only three houses, but a relatively large and old
cemetery speaks of a larger population, probably camping here in
tents during the summer seasons of the past. The burial grounds
were found to be rather extensive and give indications of containing
human bones as well as artifacts below the present surface (buried
by the tundra). The main part of the burial grounds may well
repay an excavation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael Island.</span>&mdash;Eskimo remains exist on the northeastern
point of the island beyond the present white man's village, and also
on the rock (Whale Island) opposite this point. During my visit
the ground was so overgrown by high weeds that details were
hidden. On this same northeastern point near the extension of the
white settlement is a small living Eskimo village, most of the inhabitants
of which are now of mixed blood. Across St. Michael
Bay are said to be some old traces of Eskimo, and Nelson reported
an old site in the southern part of the island. Finally at Cape
Stephens, in the western extremity of the island, there is "Stebbins,"
another living village. Nothing could be learned of any human
remains on the opposite Stuart Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norton Sound.</span>&mdash;North of St. Michael Island is Norton Sound
and Norton Bay. Along the east coast of the Sound there are three
villages still occupied, but with old accumulations. It is reported
that in this region there are some ruined houses in which mammoth
tusks had been used in the construction, but nothing definite could
be learned as to the location of these houses and the whole may be
but a story. The village of Unalaklik was of importance in the
past and its older remains would probably repay excavation. Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
sites are reported from the vicinity of Shaktolik and at Cape
Denbigh.</p>

<p>The Norton Bay region (fig. 22), now almost depopulated, had in
1840 a whole series of moderate-sized living Eskimo settlements, both
on the east and the west shore. These shallows are but little visited,
and it is probable that the remains of the villages and some at least of
the skeletal material of their burying grounds are well preserved.
They call for early attention.</p>

<p>To the west of Norton Bay, on the southern coast of Seward
Peninsula, is Golovnin<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Bay. On the eastern shore of this bay
are now, as there were in Russian times, two settlements, but the
name of one has been misplaced. On Zagoskin's map it is clearly
seen that the village Ching or Chinig corresponds in location to
what now is the mission, while what is now called "Cheenik" was
in 1840 Ikalik or Ikalikhaig. There will soon be seen another
instance of such a misapplication of the original names.</p>

<p>To the west Golovnin Bay is bounded by a large promontory ending
in Rocky Point. To the east of this point is a shallow bay,
where I found a late Eskimo house and on the elevated shore a little
to the left four fairly recent adult burials. Farther down the bay
was an Eskimo camp, without signs of anything older; but Zagoskin's
map gives a settlement, probably also a camp, at this place,
named Knikhtak. From this a rocky point projects eastward into
the bay. Behind this point is a shallow cove with elevated ground
above the beach, and at the inland end of this bay I found the remains
of a small old village. Traces of burials were seen on the elevated
ground but skeletal remains were absent.</p>

<p>On the southwestern shore of the promontory that bounds Golovnin
Bay on the west the Russians (Zagoskin) recorded two villages,
the one near to Rocky Point being Chiukak, that on a point farther
northwest being named Chaimiut. Later the name Chiukak became
applied to the former Chaimiut, while Chiukak proper was dead and
forgotten. On latest maps, such as Chart 9302 United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey, neither of the old names appears. The name
Bluff denotes a small settlement in about the location of the former
Chaimiut. Some Eskimo met in Golovnin Bay said that there are
skeletal remains near the original Chiukak, but an attempt to reach
the place failed through rough water.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">South Shore of Seward Peninsula West of Bluff</span></h3>

<p>A number of dead villages are found along this coast. The first
and largest is located a few miles west of Port Safety, 18 miles east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of Nome. This was a large village extending for a considerable
distance along the elevated beach separating an inland lagoon from
the sea. The depressions of the dwellings, of the usual dipper-with-handle
type, are very plain. Old settlers at Nome remember when
the village was still occupied. Nearer the sea the beach is said to
have been lined with burials, but the storm of 1913 took or covered
everything. (See Narrative, p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.)</p>

<p>A small Eskimo settlement existed on a rocky elevation east of
Cape Nome. There are some house sites, but the place gives little
promise of archeological importance. We found evidence that the
site must have been occupied until fairly recently. Among the
bowlders were found two skeletons.</p>

<p>A larger dead village is located near the mouth of a little stream
west of Cape Nome. It is doubtless the Azachagiag of the Zagoskin
general map. It gives no great promise archeologically.</p>

<p>From Nome to Point Spencer there are several old sites, all
"dead"; and there are one or two recently "dead" villages on Sledge
(the old Aiak or Aziak) Island. Of the coast sites, the most important
is reported to be that at Cape Woolley. It is said to have been
the stopping point of the King Islanders and may have been their
old mainland village.</p>

<p>A number of old sites and burial grounds have been seen or learned
of in Port Clarence and Salt Lake. They are marked on the map,
and those of the lake have been discussed in the Narrative (p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>).
Those on Salt Lake (Imuruk Basin) deserve attention.</p>

<p>Between Port Clarence and Cape Prince of Wales only one, and
that evidently not a very large site, was learned of at Cape York.</p>

<p>The most important site of the peninsula region is doubtless that
at the cape. Thanks to the able local teacher of that time, Mr. Clark
M. Garber, I am able to present a detailed map of this locality. It
is here that Doctor Jenness in 1926 conducted some excavations with
interesting results. But the site has barely been touched. It is the
nearest point to Asia. There are ample indications that it has been
occupied for a long period and by relatively large numbers of people.
Besides the ruined parts and old heaps there are still the skulls and
bones of many burials among the rocks about the village, and there is
evidence that more are in the ground. It is one of the chief sites of
the far northwest for systematic thorough exploration, and such exploration
is a growing necessity for all branches of anthropology
interested in the problems of the Bering Sea and Asiatic-American
connections.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Northern Shore of the Seward Peninsula</span></h3>

<p>This shore is but little known to science. It is dangerous of approach
to any except small boats. The only place that could be
visited by me was Shishmaref, a good-sized thriving Eskimo village,
on both sides of which along the sea are remains of old sites with
burials. The more important old settlement was that to the east
of the village. Here are found large and extensive heaps, the tops
of which have recently been leveled for fox cages, the whole site
belonging, regrettably, to a newly established fox farm. It is an
old site, though probably occupied up to white man's times, and
is doubtless of some importance. Excavations would still be possible,
as the bulk of the remains is intact; and though the surface skeletal
material has been removed (part saved for our collections), there are
indications of surface burials (assimilations by the tundra) in the
ground.</p>

<p>Between Wales and Shishmaref are several dead sites, as shown
on the map, and some of them, judging from the information obtained,
are of promise. One of these settlements, "Tapkhaig," was
evidently still a living village at the time of Zagoskin (1840).</p>

<p>Northeast and east of Shishmaref the coast is known even less than
that to the west. A few miles off Shishmaref I saw from a distance&mdash;the
boat could not approach nearer&mdash;what to all appearances was a
large ridge of ruins, and from various maps and other sources information
was obtained of several other sites, all of which represent
former villages. From one of these sites on the Bucknell River Mr.
Carl Lomen secured a fine piece of fossil ivory carving, and the site
is said to be of much promise. The whole coast is a virgin field for
archeology.</p>

<p>Figure 24 shows the village sites that it was possible to locate in
these regions. Nearly all these are now "dead villages," though some
Eskimo may still occasionally camp in their vicinity. A large
present settlement of the Eskimo, well advanced toward civilization,
is found at Kotzebue, and fish camps extend from here along the
shore in the direction of Cape Blossom. Another important recent
living village and school center is Noorvik on the lower Kobuk
River.</p>

<p>Inquiries as to old sites in this region were greatly assisted by Mr.
Sylvester Chance, at the time of my visit the supervisor of the Government
schools of the district. At my request and with the aid
of the natives Mr. Chance has compiled a list of such sites and
settlements as could still be remembered, and the information has
been incorporated into these records.</p>

<p>Among the more important ruins of this vicinity are apparently
those at and near Cape Krusenstern, and again those near Kevalina
farther to the northward. Archeological specimens of considerable
interest were seen and partly secured from both localities. The old
Kevalina especially should receive early attention, for it is being
excavated by the Eskimo of the present village, though fortunately
this is at some distance.</p>

<h4>POINT HOPE (TIGARA)</h4>

<p>This is the most important ruin as well as living Eskimo village
in Arctic Alaska. It is unanimously declared by the Eskimo of the
coast to be one of the oldest settlements and has always been the
largest native center on the coast. The point was called Golovnin
Point by the early Russians; it was called Point Hope by Beechey
in 1826 in honor of Sir William Johnston Hope. At the time of its
visit by the revenue cutter <em>Corwin</em>, 1884, there are said to have been
two villages;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the second being possibly at the site of the old whaling
station. Rasmussen, who visited the village about 1924, speaks of
it in part as follows:<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> "Point Hope or Tikeraq, 'the pointing finger,'
is one of the most interesting Eskimo settlements on the whole coast
of Alaska, and has doubtless the largest collection of ruins. The
old village, now deserted, consists of 122 very large houses, but as
the sea is constantly washing away parts of the land and carrying
off more houses, it is impossible to say what may have been the original
number. Probably the village here and its immediate neighborhood
had at one time something like 2,000 souls, or as many as are
now to be found throughout the whole of the Northwest Passage
between the Magnetic Pole and Herschel Island."</p>

<p>The ruins are to the northwest and west of the present village.
Those to the northwest consist of imposing heaps, which together
form an elevated ridge facing the sea. It is said that this old
settlement was abandoned because of the encroachments upon it by
the sea, particularly during storms.</p>

<p>The ruins of this main compound have been for several years
assiduously excavated inch by inch by the local Eskimo, and thousands
of articles of great variety, of stone, bone, ivory, and wood,
with here and there in the uppermost layers an object of metal, are
being gathered and sold to all comers. With these are found a few
human skulls and bones, but especially the skulls and bones of various
animals, all of which unfortunately have hitherto been left behind in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>the mud. But the probably most valuable central and lower portions
of the piles remain. The locality calls loudly for proper exploration,
which will well repay any museum by the quantity and
value of the specimens that are sure to be recovered.</p>

<h4>POINT HOPE TO POINT BARROW</h4>

<p>Information about this part of the northwesternmost coast of
Alaska was obtained principally from Jim Allen, the trader at
Wainwright, and Charles Brower, the trader at Barrow; but parts
of the coast were also examined in person. The number of old sites
is rather large, but it appears that there is not much of special
promise until we reach near Barrow.</p>

<p>Old "igloos" southwest of Barrow: From 5 to 8 miles southwest
of Barrow and at some distance (up to about 400 yards) from
the shore there existed, and in part still exist, a series of elevations
which the natives of Barrow always regarded as natural. On
excavation the larger of these elevations proved to be old structures
with numerous burials and cultural objects, and the remains, as
shown elsewhere, are exceptional for this coast. Six of these
"mounds" have been excavated by the University of Pennsylvania
Expedition (Van Valin), while several are still remaining. It is
very important that these should be carefully excavated before they
are attacked by the natives of Barrow for mercenary purposes.</p>


<h4>BARROW AND POINT BARROW</h4>

<p>Two large living villages, with old sites and inhumed (natural)
burials in their vicinity, and with some old remains between them.
Barrow is the most important present mixed settlement and center of
civilization in the Arctic. Besides the school, it contains a mission
hospital and recently a meteorological observatory and wireless station.
The tundras to the east of the village for about 1½ miles show
patches of burials, particularly in the more distant parts of this
region on the elevations to both sides of a small stream.</p>

<p>Much archeological work remains to be done about Barrow, particularly
in the remainder of the old "igloos." East of Point Barrow
the population is very sparse and no ruins of any note or settlements
are reported before those of the Barter Island and the mouth
of the Colville River.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The St. Lawrence and Diomede Islands</span></h3>


<h4>ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND</h4>

<p>Ranking in archeological and anthropological importance with
Wales and in some respects perhaps even exceeding the latter, is
the large island of St. Lawrence, with the almost forgotten little
Punuk group at its eastern extremity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/figure_26a.jpg" width="700" height="396" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 26.</span>&mdash;Russian map of St. Lawrence Island, 1849. (Tebenkof)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The main island was discovered by Bering on St. Lawrence Day,
August 10, 1728, and it was found peopled by the Eskimo. In 1849
an excellent map of it was published by Tebenkof in Novo-Archangelsk,
and on this map (fig. 26) are indicated about a dozen smaller
or larger Eskimo settlements, some of which, however, are not named
and may already have been "dead."</p>

<p>About 1878 there were still six settlements with somewhat less than
1,500 Eskimo inhabitants on the island. That winter (1878-79) not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
less than 1,000 of the population died of famine (Hooper), three of
the villages becoming completely depopulated and a fourth nearly so.
The Punuk Island village may have become extinct about the same
time.</p>

<p>To-day there are on the St. Lawrence Island but two living settlements,
the main one, now known as Gambell, at the old site of Chibukak
on the northwestern cape, and the other, Savonga, about 40
miles east of it, near Cape North.</p>

<p>A number of the old sites on this island, and also that on one of the
Punuks, indicate a long occupation, antedating by far the advent
of the Russians. The accumulations rise in some places to imposing
heaps or ridges. Their frozen contents yield quantities of fossil
ivory, all of which shows the work of man, and among them occur
specimens with fine curvilinear designs and of high scientific as well
as artistic value.</p>

<p>Through Nelson in 1881 and R. D. Moore in 1912 the Smithsonian
Institution has acquired a large quantity of human skeletal material
from the main island, and there is now (1928) an expedition of the
Institution under Collins on the Punuk as well as the St. Lawrence
exploring some of the principal ruins.</p>


<h4>THE DIOMEDE ISLANDS AND THE ASIATIC COAST<br />

[<span class="smcap">Figs. 27 and 28</span>]</h4>

<p>The smaller or American Diomede, though a very inhospitable
place, supports, and that evidently since long, a small Eskimo village
of stone houses, below and about which there is a considerable
accumulation of refuse. Doctor Jenness dug here for a short time
in 1926.</p>

<p>The larger or Russian Diomede has two villages, each of which is
larger than the one on the smaller island. There are also said
to be some remains in a broad depression on the eastern side of the
island, while skeletal remains are reported by the natives to exist
among the rocks on the top. This island is in need of thorough
attention. Its people are reputed to be skilled ivory workers. They
come yearly to Nome, where they were visited and seen at their
work by the writer. They bring each year some fossil ivory, said
to come mainly from the Asiatic coast, and among this are occasionally
articles of much interest.</p>

<p>Ruins of Eskimo villages are also present along the coasts of the
Chukchee Peninsula, both those facing the Bering Sea and those
along the Arctic. Very little is definitely known or can be found
from the American Eskimo about these ruins, and some of them
may not be Eskimo. Nelson in his book (p. 265) reports briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
on a few about Cape Wankarem. Interesting objects of the fossil
ivory culture are said to occur in these old sites as far west as the
Kolyma, but nothing is certain except that there are ruins, that a
good number of them are probably Eskimo, and that fossil ivory,
both worked (walrus) and unworked (mammoth), comes from these
coasts. A noteworthy report is that of a large native cemetery
on the Bering Sea side, with hundreds of burials in rough stone-slab
graves. Information of this was given me by Joe Bernard,
well known in connection with Bering Sea explorations, who had
seen the site in person.</p>

<h2>PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Earlier Data</span></h3>

<p>The previously published data on the western Eskimo are few in
number and mostly not as well documented as would be desirable.
There are, however, a good number of references to the physical
characteristics of the people by explorers. The main of these are
given below. These references in general are not of much scientific
value, yet in some instances they approach this closely and are of
considerable interest collectively.</p>

<p>1784, Cook:<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inlet which we had now quitted, was distinguished by Captain Cook
with the name of Prince William's Sound. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The natives whom we
saw were in general of a middling stature, though many of them were under
it. They were square or strong chested, with short thick necks, and large
broad visages which were for the most part rather flat. The most disproportioned
part of their body appeared to be their heads, which were of great magnitude.
Their teeth were of a tolerable whiteness, broad, well set, and equal
in size. Their noses had full round points, turned up at the tip; and their
eyes, though not small, were scarcely proportioned to the largeness of their
faces. They had black hair which was strong, straight, and thick. Their
beards were in general thin or deficient, but the hairs growing about the lips,
of those who have them, were bristly or stiff and often of a brownish color;
and some of the elderly men had large, thick straight beards. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The
complexion of some of the females, and of the children, is white without any
mixture of red. Many of the men, whom we saw naked, had rather a swarthy
cast, which was scarcely the effect of any stain, as it is not their custom to
paint their bodies.</p>

<p>Vol. 3, page 31: All the Americans we had seen since our arrival on that
coast (west coast of Alaska) had round, chubby faces, and high cheek bones,
and were rather low of stature.</p>

<p>Ibid., page 72: <em>Norton Sound.</em>&mdash;The woman was short and squat and her
visage was plump and round. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Her husband was well made and about
5 feet 2 inches in height. His hair was black and short, and he had but little
beard. His complexion was of a light copper cast. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The teeth of both
of them were black, and appeared as if they had been filed down level with
the gums.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>1821, Kotzebue:<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Kotzebue Sound.</em>&mdash;The Americans [i. e., Eskimo] are of a middle size, robust
make, and healthy appearance; their countenances *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are characterized
by small eyes and very high cheek bones.</p></div>

<p>1832, Beechey:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The western Esquimaux appear to be intimately connected with the tribes inhabiting
the northern and northeastern shores of America, in language, features,
manners, and customs. They at the same time, in many respects, resemble
the Tschutschi, from whom they are probably descended. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>They are taller in stature than the eastern Esquimaux, their average height
being about 5 feet 7½ inches. They are also a better looking race, if I may
judge from the natives I saw in Baffin's Bay, and from the portraits of others
that have been published. At a comparatively early age, however, they (the
women in particular) soon lose this comeliness, and old age is attended with a
haggard and careworn countenance, rendered more unbecoming by sore eyes
and by teeth worn to the gums by frequent mastication of hard substances.</p></div>

<p>1850, Latham:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Physically the Eskimo is a Mongol and Asiatic.</p>

<p>The Eskimos of the Atlantic are not only easily distinguished from the
tribes of American aborigines which lie to the south or west of them, and with
which they come in contact, but they stand in strong contrast and opposition
to them&mdash;a contrast and opposition exhibited equally in appearance, manners,
language, and one which has had full justice done to it by those who have
written on the subject.</p>

<p>It is not so with the Eskimos of Russian-America, and the parts that look
upon the Pacific. These are so far from being separated by any broad and
trenchant line of demarcation from the proper Indians or the so-called red
race, that they pass gradually into it, and that in respect to their habits, manner,
and appearance, equally. So far is this the case that he would be a bold
man who should venture, in speaking of the southern tribes of Russian-America,
to say here the Eskimo area ends and here a different area begins.</p></div>

<p>1853, Hooper:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Kotzebue Sound Esquimeaux.</em>&mdash;The men generally were taller than the average
of Europeans, strongly built and well formed; some had well-marked
features *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. The women, were generally short, the visages of the younger
ones tolerably good but *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the very reverse was the case with the dames
of more advanced age. Their figures inclined to the squat, their mien and expression
promised intelligence and good nature. Although both sexes had in
most instances the round flat face of the Mongolian cast, a few individuals
possessed well-defined, though petite features, and all had fine eyes.</p></div>

<p><em>The Eskimos.</em>&mdash;By comparing the accounts transmitted by different writers
we find that the various tribes, however widely separated geographically, differ
but slightly from each other in appearance, manners, customs, or language.
They are, however, by no means as uniform in size as might have been
expected. Those inhabiting the vicinity of Norton and Kotzebue Sounds are
by far the finest and tallest, while those living between Cape Lisburne and
Point Barrow are, like the tribes of the eastern portions of America, much
shorter in stature, and bespeak the inferiority of the districts in which
they live.</p>

<p>Both sexes are well proportioned, stout, muscular, and active. The hands
and feet are small and beautifully formed, which is ascribed by some writers
to their sedentary habits, but this cannot be the case, as probably no people
take more exercise or are more constantly employed. Their height varies. In
the southern parts some of the men are 6 feet; in the more northern there is
a perceptible diminution, though by no means to the extent generally imagined.</p>

<p>Their faces are flat, their cheek bones projecting, and their eyes small,
deeply set, and, like the eyebrows, black. Their noses are broad; their ears
are large, and generally lengthened by the appendage of weighty ornaments;
their mouths are well formed, their lips are thin. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The teeth of the Eskimos are regular, but from the nature of their food and
from their practice of preparing hides by chewing, are worn down almost to
the gums at an early age. Their hair is straight, black, and coarse; the men
have it closely cut on the crown, like that of a Capuchin friar, leaving a band
about two inches broad, which gradually increases in length towards the back
of the neck; the women merely part their hair in the middle, and, if wealthy,
ornament it with strings of beads. The possession of a beard is very rare,
but a slight moustache is not infrequent. Their complexion, if divested of its
usual covering of dirt, can hardly be called dark; on the contrary, it displays
a healthy, rosy tint, and were it not for the custom of tattooing the chin
some of the girls might be called pretty, even in the European acceptation of
the term.</p></div>

<p>1861, Richardson:<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Eskimos are remarkably uniform in physical appearance throughout
their far-stretching area, there being perhaps no other nation in the world so
unmixed in blood. Frobisher's people were struck with their resemblance in
features and general aspect to the Samoyeds and their physiognomy has been
held by all ethnologists to be of the Mongolian or Tartar type. Doctor Latham
calls the Samoyeds Hyperborean Mongolidae, and the Eskimos he ranges among
the American Mongolidae, embracing in the latter group all the native races of
the New World. The Mongol type of countenance is, however, more strongly
reproduced in the Eskimos than in the red Indians&mdash;the conterminous Tinné
tribes differing greatly in their features, and the more remote Indians still
more.</p>

<p>Generally the Eskimos have broadly egg-shaped faces with considerable
prominence of the rounded cheeks caused by the arching of the cheek bones, but
few or no angular projections even in the old people, whose features are always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>much weather beaten and furrowed. The greatest breadth of the face is just
below the eyes, the forehead tapers upward, ending narrowly, but not acutely,
and in like manner the chin is a blunt cone; both the forehead and the chin
recede, the egg outline showing in profile, though not so strongly, as in a
front view. The nose is broad and depressed, but not in all, some individuals
having prominent noses, yet almost all have wider nostrils than Europeans.
The eyes have small and oblique apertures like the Chinese, and from frequent
attacks of ophthalmia and the effect of lamp smoke in their winter habitations
adults of both sexes are disfigured by excoriated or ulcerated eyelids. The
sight of these people is, from its constant exercise, extremely keen, and the
habit of bringing the eyelids nearly together when looking at distant objects
has in all the grown males produced a striking cluster of furrows radiating
from the outer corners of each eye over the temples.</p>

<p>The complexions of the Eskimos when relieved from smoke and dirt are
nearly white and show little of the copper color of the red Indians. Infants
have a good deal of red on the cheeks, and when by chance their faces are
tolerably clean are much like European children, the national peculiarities of
countenance being slighter at an early age. Many of the young women appear
even pretty from the liveliness and good nature that beams in their countenances.
The old women are frightfully ugly *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

<p>The young men have little beard, but some of the old ones have a tolerable
show of long gray hairs on the upper lip and chin. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The Eskimo
beard, however, is in no instance so dense as a European one.</p>

<p>The hair of the head is black and coarse, the lips thickish, and the teeth of
the young people white and regular, but the sand that, through want of cleanliness,
mixes with their food, wears the teeth down at an early age almost to
the level of the gums, so that the incisors often have broad crowns like the
molars.</p>

<p>The average stature of the Eskimos is below the English standard, but they
can not be said to be a dwarfish race. The men vary in height from about
5 feet to 5 feet 10 inches or even more. They are a broad-shouldered race,
and when seated in their kayaks look tall and muscular, but when standing
lose their apparent height by a seemingly disproportionate shortness of the
lower extremities. This want of symmetry may arise from the dress, as the
proportions of various parts of the body have not been tested by accurate
measurements. The hands and feet are delicately small and well formed.
Mr. Simpson (Blue Book, 1855) observed an undue shortness of the thumb in
the western Eskimos, which, if it exists farther to the east, was not noted by
the members of the searching expeditions.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Page 136: The Innuit, as they call themselves, belong to the same family as
the northern and western Eskimo. I have frequently used the term Eskimo
in referring to them, but they are in many respects very different
people. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It should be thoroughly and definitely understood that they are not
Indians nor have they any known relation, physically *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to the Indian
tribes of North America. Their grammar, appearance, habits, and even their
anatomy, especially in the form of the skull, separate them widely from the
Indian race. On the other hand, it is almost equally questionable whether
they are even distinctly [distantly?] related to the Chukchees and other probably
Mongolian races, of the eastern part of Siberia.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
<p>The Innuit of Norton Sound and the vicinity are of three tribes, each of
which, while migrating at certain seasons, has its own peculiar territory. The
peninsula between Kotzebue and Norton Sounds is inhabited by the Kaviaks
or Kaviagemut Innuit. The neck of this peninsula is occupied by the Mahlemut
Innuit. The shore of Norton Sound south of Cape Denbigh to Pastolik
is the country of the Unaleets or Unaligmut Innuit. The habits of these
tribes are essentially similar. They are in every respect superior to any
tribe of Indians with which I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Their complexion I have described as brunet. The effect of the sun and
wind, especially in summer, is to darken their hue, and from observing those
who lived in the fort, I am inclined to think that a regular course of bathing
would do much toward whitening them. They are sometimes very tall; I
have often seen both men and women nearly 6 feet in height and have known
several instances where men were taller. Their average height equals that
of most civilized races. Their strength is often very great. I have seen a
Mahlemut take a 100-pound sack of flour under each arm and another in his
teeth and walk with them from the storehouse to the boat, a distance of some
20 rods, without inconvenience.</p>

<p>Page 140: The women *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are often of pleasing appearance, sometimes
quite pretty. They preserve their beauty much longer than Indian
women. Their clear complexion and high color, with their good humor, make
them agreeable companions, and they are often very intelligent. A noticeable
feature is their teeth. These are always sound and white, but are almost
cylindrical, and in old people are worn down even with the gums, producing a
singular appearance. The eyes are not oblique as in the Mongolian races,
but are small, black, and almost even with the face. The nose is flat and
disproportionately small. Many of the Innuit have heavy beards and mustaches,
while some pull out the former.</p>

<p>Page 17: I *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* made the acquaintance of a fine-looking young Mahlemut
who *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* introduced me to his wife and child, the latter about 2
years old. The former was not particularly ugly or pretty. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The husband
was a fine-looking, athletic fellow, standing about 5 feet 5 inches, with a
clear brunet complexion, fine color, dark eyes, and finely arched eyebrows.
The flat nose, common to all the Eskimo tribes, was not very strongly marked
in him, and a pleasant smile, displaying two rows of very white teeth, conquered
any objection I might have felt to his large mouth. The baby looked
like any other baby. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Page 376: It has been frequently remarked that the Tuski and Innuit
tribes have a Mongolian cast of countenance. This, upon an actual comparison,
will be found to be much less than is usually supposed. The real points of
resemblance are principally in the complexion, which is somewhat similar, and
in the eyes. But the eyes of the Innuit are not oblique, as in the Chinese.
They have an apparent obliquity, which is due to the peculiar form of the
zygomatic arch, but the eyes themselves are perfectly horizontal. The prominent
characteristics of the Orarian<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> skull are the strongly developed coronary
ridge, the obliquity of the zygoma, and its greater capacity compared with the
Indian cranium. The former is essentially pyramidal, while the latter more
nearly approaches a cubic shape.</p>

<p>The mean capacity (in cubic centimeters) of three Tuski skulls from Plover
Bay, according to Doctor Wyman, was 1,505; that of 20 crania of northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>Eskimo, according to Doctor Davis, was 1,475, and that of 4 Innuit crania of
Norton Sound was 1,320; thus showing a wide variation. The mean capacity
of 20 West American Indian crania was only 1,284.06. The mean height of all
the Orarian skulls above referred to was 136.55 millimeters, against a breadth
of 134.47 millimeters, while the height of the Indian skulls was 120.14 millimeters,
against a breadth of 100.025 millimeters. The zygomatic diameter of
the Orarian crania was 134.92 millimeters, while that of 12 Indian skulls was
134.65 millimeters. The Orarian skulls were most dolichocephalic, and the
Indian most brachycephalic. The latter averaged 378.71 cubic centimeters less
capacity than the former. The average height of the Orarians, except among
the stunted tribes of the extreme north, will average as great as that of their
Indian neighbors. The strength and activity of the former far exceed that
of any northern Indians with whom I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Page 401: The Kaniagmuts are of middle stature and a complexion more
reddish than that of the Aleutians or more northern Innuit. They are stoutly
built, with large broad faces, and their hair is coarse, black, and straight.</p>

<p>Page 407: The Magemuts *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are tall, finely formed, and have very
fair complexions. Blue eyes are not unknown among them, but their hair
is black and their beards are very light.</p>

<p>The Ekogmuts. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A noticeable feature in many of them is the extreme
hairiness of their persons. Many have very strong black beards and
hairy bodies.</p>

<p>Page 410: The Point Barrow tribe are said by Richardson to be called
Nuwungmëun. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* These northern Innuit are very few in
number. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Simpson mentions that their thumbs appeared to be disproportionately
short. The same may be true of the Norton Sound Innuit; at all events, no
white man can wear one of their mittens comfortably until the thumb is
lengthened.</p></div>

<p>Doctor Otis, of the United States Army Medical Museum, says that
the skulls found in the northern mounds have the same peculiarities
which distinguish all Orarian crania, and that both are instantly
distinguishable from any Indian skulls.</p>

<p>These people are by no means the dwarfish race they were formerly supposed
to be. In stature they are not inferior to many other races and are
robust, muscular, and active, inclining rather to spareness than corpulence.
The tallest individual was found to be 5 feet 10½ inches, and the shortest
5 feet 1 inch. The heaviest man weighed 195 pounds, and the lightest 125
pounds. The individuals weighed and measured were taken indiscriminately
as they visited the ship, and were all supposed to have attained their full
stature. Their chief muscular strength is in the back, which is best displayed
in their games of wrestling. The shoulders are square, or rather raised,
making the neck appear shorter than it really is, and the chest is deep; but
in strength of arm they can not compete with our sailors. The hand is
small, short, broad, and rather thick, and the thumb appears short, giving
an air of clumsiness in handling anything; and the power of grasping is not
great. The lower limbs are in good proportion to the body, and the feet,
like the hands, are short and broad with a high instep. Considering their
frequent occupations as hunters, they do not excel in speed nor in jumping
over a height or a level space, but they display great agility in leaping to
kick with both feet together an object hanging as high as the chin, or even
above the head. In walking, their tread is firm and elastic, the step short
and quick; and the toes being turned outward and the knee at each advance
inclining in the same direction, give a certain peculiarity to their gait difficult
to describe.</p>

<p>The hair is sooty black, without gloss, and coarse, cut in an even line across
the forehead, but allowed to grow long at the back of the head and about the
ears, whilst the crown is cropped close or shaven. The color of the skin is
a light yellowish brown, but variable in shade, and in a few instances was
observed to be very dark. In the young, the complexion is comparatively fair,
presenting a remarkably healthy sunburnt appearance, through which the
rosy hue of the cheeks is visible; before middle life, however, this, from
exposure, gives place to a weather-beaten appearance, so that it is difficult to
guess their ages.</p>

<p>The face is flat, broad, rounded, and commonly plump, the cheek bones high,
the forehead low, but broad across the eyebrows, and narrowing upwards;
the whole head becomes somewhat pointed toward the crown. The nose is
short and flat, giving an appearance of considerable space between the eyes.
The eyes are brown, of different shades, usually dark, seldom if ever altogether
black, and generally have a soft expression; some have a peculiar
glitter, which we call gipsy-like. They slope slightly upwards from the nose,
and have a fold of skin stretching across the inner angle to the upper eyelid,
most perceptible in childhood, which gives to some individuals a cast of countenance
almost perfectly Chinese. The eyelids seem tumid, opening to only a
moderate extent, and the slightly arched eyebrows scarcely project beyond
them. The ears are by no means large, but frequently stand out sideways.
The mouth is prominent and large, and the lips, especially the lower one,
rather thick and protruding. The jawbones are strong, supporting remarkably
firm and commonly regular teeth. In the youthful these are in general
white, but toward middle age they have lost their enamel and become black
or are worn down to the gums. The incisors of the lower jaw do not pass behind
those of the upper, but meet edge to edge, so that by the time an individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>arrives at maturity, the opposing surfaces of the eye and front teeth
are perfectly flat, independently of the wear they are subjected to in every
possible way to assist the hands. The expression of the countenance is one
of habitual good humor in the great majority of both sexes, but is a good deal
marred in the men by wearing heavy lip ornaments. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>While young the women are generally well formed and good looking, having
good eyes and teeth. To a few, who besides possessed something of the Circassian
cast of features, was attributed a certain degree of brunette beauty.
Their hands and feet are small, and the former delicate in the young, but soon
become rough and coarse when the household cares devolve upon them. Their
movements are awkward and ungainly, and though capable of making long
journeys on foot, it is almost painful to see many of them walk. Unlike the
men, they shuffle along commonly a little sideways, with the toes turned inwards,
stooping slightly forward as if carrying a burden, and their general
appearance is not enhanced by the coat being made large enough to accommodate
a child on the back, whilst the tight-fitting nether garment only serves
to display the deformity of their bow legs. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The physical constitution of both sexes is strong, and they bear exposure
during the coldest weather for many hours together without appearing inconvenienced,
further than occasional frostbites on the cheeks. They also show
great endurance of fatigue during their journeys in the summer, particularly
that part in which they require to drag the family boat, laden with their summer
tent and all their moveables, on a sledge over the ice.</p>

<p>Extreme longevity is probably not unknown among them; but as they take
no heed to number the years as they pass, they can form no guess of their
own ages, invariably stating "they have many years." Judging altogether
from appearance, a man whom we saw in the neighborhood of Kotzebue Sound
could not be less than 80 years of age. He had long been confined to his bed
and appeared quite in his dotage. There was another at Point Barrow, whose
wrinkled face, silvery hair, toothless gums, and shrunk limbs indicated an age
nothing short of 75. This man died in the month of April, 1853, and had paid
a visit to the ship only a few days before, when his intellect seemed unimpaired,
and his vision wonderfully acute for his time of life. There is another
still alive, who is said to be a few years older.</p></div>

<p>About 3,000 Innuits inhabit the northwest coast of America, from the Colville
River, on the east, to Bering Strait, including the islands therein, on the
west. Many of these came under my observation while cruising in the Arctic
Ocean in command of the <em>Corwin</em>.</p>

<p>In appearance they are tall and muscular, many being 6 feet in height, and
some were seen that would exceed that even. Their peculiar dress gives them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>a squat appearance, and their stature seems less than it is in reality. The
women are much shorter than the men, but both sexes are strong and active,
though not equal in these respects to the Tchuktchis and other reindeer tribes
of Siberia.</p>

<p>The face of the Innuit is broad below the eyes, the forehead is narrow and
receding, the chin and lower jaw broad and heavy. The nose is usually broad
and flattened, but not always; occasionally one is seen whose features are well
formed and handsome. In the young children this is the almost invariable
rule; many of them are really beautiful. The eyes are small and black, and
appear to be slightly oblique, and for this reason, perhaps more than any other,
they have been classed with the Mongolidae. They have large mouths, thick,
loosely hanging lips, and fine, strong teeth. These, however, from eating raw
food, are usually very much worn. The labrets worn in the lips are hideous-looking
things, made of bone, glass, stone, ivory, or in fact anything within the
reach of the native which can be worked into the requisite shape.</p>

<p>They have rather light skin, very different from the Indians of the plains;
and in this also they differ from the Tchuktchis, being much lighter, and when
cleansed from the dirt which usually covers them, and freed from the sunburn
and tan due to long exposure, they become quite fair. They have small, well-formed
hands and feet, much smaller in proportion than white men. This was
particularly noticeable when buying boots and mittens from them for our
use; only the largest sizes made by them could be used at all. They are generally
without beard, but as the men grow old, they sometimes have a thin,
straggling mustache and beard, but it is never full and regular. The hair is
coarse and black.</p></div>

<p>Pages 37-38: The following table will show that physically the Inyu of
North American coast does not conform to the typical idea of the Eskimo.
They are robust, healthy people, fairer than the North American Indian, with
brown eyes and straight black hair. The men are beardless until they attain
the age of from 20 to 25 years, and even then it is very light and scattering,
and is always clipped close in the winter; at this season they also cut off
their eyebrows and tonsure their crown like a priest, with bangs over their
forehead. Their hands and feet are extremely small and symmetrical; they
are graceful in their movements when unincumbered by heavy clothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In stature these people are of a medium height, robust, and muscular, inclining
rather to spareness than corpulence, though the fullness of the face and the
thick fur clothing often gives the impression of the latter. There is, however,
considerable individual variation among them in this respect. The women are
as a rule shorter than the men, occasionally almost dwarfish, though some
women are taller than many of the men. The tallest man observed measured
5 feet 9½ inches and the shortest 4 feet 11 inches. The tallest woman was
5 feet 3 inches in height and the shortest 4 feet ½ inch. The heaviest man
weighed 204 pounds and the lightest 126 pounds. One woman weighed 192
pounds and the shortest woman was also the lightest, weighing only 100
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>pounds. The hands and feet are small and well shaped, though the former
soon become distorted and roughened by work. We did not observe the peculiar
breadth of hands noticed by Doctor Simpson, nor is the shortness of the
thumb which he mentions sufficient to attract attention. Their feet are so
small that only one of our party, who is much below the ordinary size, was
able to wear the boots made by the natives for themselves. Small and delicate
hands and feet appear to be a universal characteristic of the Eskimo race and
have been mentioned by most observers from Greenland to Alaska.</p>

<p>The face is broad, flat, and round, with high cheek bones and rather low
forehead, broad across the brow and narrowing above, while the head is somewhat
pointed toward the crown. The peculiar shape of the head is somewhat
masked by the way of wearing the hair and is best seen in the skull. The
nose is short, with little or no bridge&mdash;few Eskimo were able to wear our
spring eyeglasses&mdash;and broad, especially across the alæ nasæ, with a peculiar,
rounded, somewhat bulbous tip, and large nostrils. The eyes are horizontal,
with rather full lids and are but slightly sunken below the level of the face.</p>

<p>The mouth is large and the lips full, especially the under one. The teeth are
naturally large, and in youth are white and generally regular, but by middle
age they are generally worn down to flat-crowned stumps, as is usual among
the Eskimo. The color of the skin is a light yellowish brown, with often considerable
ruddy color on the cheeks and lips. There appears to be much natural
variation in the complexion, some women being nearly as fair as Europeans,
while other individuals seem to have naturally a coppery color. In most cases
the complexion appears darker than it really is from the effects of exposure
to the weather. All sunburn very easily, especially in the spring, when there
is a strong reflection from the snow.</p>

<p>The old are much wrinkled, and they frequently suffer from watery eyes,
with large sacks under them, which begin to form at a comparatively early
age. There is considerable variation in features, as well as complexion, among
them, even in cases where there seems to be no suspicion of mixed blood.
There were several men among them with decided aquiline noses and something
of a Hebrew cast of countenance. The eyes are of various shades of
dark brown&mdash;two pairs of light hazel eyes were observed&mdash;and are often
handsome. The hair is black, perfectly straight, and very thick. With the men
it is generally coarser than with the women, who sometimes have very long
and silky hair, though it generally does not reach much below the shoulders.
The eyebrows are thin and the beard scanty, growing mostly upon the upper
lip and chin and seldom appearing under the age of 20. In this they resemble
most Eskimo. Back, however, speaks of the "luxuriant beards and
flowing mustaches" of the Eskimo of the Great Fish River. Some of the
older men have rather heavy black mustaches, but there is much variation
in this respect. The upper part of the body, as much as is commonly exposed
in the house, is remarkably free from hair. The general expression is good
humored and attractive.</p>

<p>The males, even when very young, are remarkable for their graceful and
dignified carriage. The body is held erect, with the shoulders square and
chest well thrown out, the knees straight, and the feet firmly planted on the
ground. In walking they move with long swinging elastic strides, the toes
well turned out and the arms swinging. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I should say that they walked like well-built athletic white men. The women,
on the other hand, although possessing good physiques, are singularly ungraceful
in their movements. They walk at a sort of shuffling half trot, with
the toes turned in, the body leaning forward, and the arms hanging awkwardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>A noticeable thing about the women is the remarkable flexibility of the
body and limbs and the great length of time they can stand in a stooping
posture. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Both men and women have a very fair share of muscular
strength. Some of the women especially showed a power of carrying heavy
loads superior to most white men. We were able to make no other comparisons
of their strength with ours. Their power of endurance is very great, and
both sexes are capable of making long distances on foot. Two men sometimes
spend 24 hours tramping through the rough ice in search of seals, and
we knew of instances where small parties made journeys of 50 or 75 miles on
foot without stopping to sleep.</p>

<p>The women are not prolific. Although all the adults are or have been
married, many of them are childless, and few have more than two children.
One woman was known to have at least four, but investigations of this sort
were rendered extremely difficult by the universal custom of adoption. Doctor
Simpson heard of a "rare case" where one woman had borne seven children.
We heard of no twins at either village, though we obtained the Eskimo word
for twins.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people who live on the extreme northwest corner of our continent are
far from being an ugly or an ill-made race. Though they are not tall&mdash;a man
of 5 feet 10 inches is a tall man among them&mdash;they are well proportioned,
broad shouldered, and deep chested. The men, as a rule, are particularly well
"set up," like well-drilled soldiers and walk and stand with a great deal of
grace and dignity.</p>

<p>The women do not have such good figures, but are inclined to slouchiness.
They are seldom inclined to be fleshy, though their plump, round faces, along
with their thick fur clothing, often give them the appearance of being fat.
They generally have round, full faces, with rather high cheek bones, small,
rounded noses, full lips, and small chins. Still, you now and then see a person
with an oval face and aquiline nose. Many of the men are very good looking,
and some of the young women are exceedingly pretty. Their complexion is a
dark brunet, often with a good deal of bright color on the cheeks and especially
on the lips. They sunburn very much, especially in the spring, when the glare
of the sun is reflected from the snow. They have black or dark-brown eyes and
abundant black hair. The women's hair is often long and silky. When they
are young they have white and regular teeth, but these are worn down to
stumps before middle life is reached. Cheerful and merry faces are the rule.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Personal appearance.</em>&mdash;There are three types observable among the Arctic
Eskimos of Alaska. The tall, cadaverous natives of Kangoot, Seelawik, Koovuk,
and Kikiktowruk, on Kotzebue Sound, who live on fish, ptarmigans, and marmots.
They always have a hungry look and habitually wear a grin of fiendish
glee at having circumvented an adverse fate. There is a tendency among these
people to migrate north.</p>

<p>Then there is the tall, strongly knit type of the Nooatoks, a gigantic race, of
a splendid physique that would be remarkable in any part of the world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<p>Rugged as the mountains among which they live, vigorous and courageous,
they stop at nothing but the impossible to accomplish a desired end. Their
food supply is the reindeer, mountain sheep, ptarmigans, and fish. There are
many of the coast natives of this type, but they lack the healthy glow and the
indomitable will of the Nooatoks.</p>

<p>The third type is the short, stumpy one, probably that of the old Eskimo before
the admixture with southern tribes, now found on the Arctic coast. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The Eskimos have coarse, black hair, some with a tinge of brown. Many of
the coast people of both sexes are bald from scrofulous eruptions. Males have
the crown of the head closely cropped, so that reindeer may not see the waving
locks when the hunter creeps behind bunch grass. They have black eyes and
high cheek bones. The bones of the face are better protected from the severity
of the climate by a thicker covering of flesh than southern races.</p>

<p>Among the coast people the nose is broad and flat, with very little or no ridge
between the eyes. The adult males have short mustaches, and some of the
elder ones&mdash;more noticeable in the interior&mdash;have rough, scraggy beards. Generally
their beard is very scant, and most of them devote otherwise idle
hours to pulling out the hairs.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Eskimo from Bering Strait to the lower Yukon are fairly well-built
people, averaging among the men about 5 feet 2 or 3 inches in height. The
Yukon Eskimo and those living southward from that river to the Kuskokwim
are, as a rule, shorter and more squarely built. The Kuskokwim people are
darker of complexion than those to the northward, and have rounder features.
The men commonly have a considerable growth of hair on their faces, becoming
at times a thin beard 2 or 3 inches in length, with a well-developed
mustache. No such development of beard was seen elsewhere in the territory
visited.</p>

<p>The people in the coast region between the mouths of the Kuskokwim and the
Yukon have peculiarly high cheek bones and sharp chins, which unite to give
their faces a curiously pointed, triangular appearance. At the village of
Kaialigamut I was impressed by the strong development of the superciliary
ridge. From a point almost directly over the pupil of the eye and extending
thence inward to the median line of the forehead is a strong bony ridge causing
the brow to stand out sharply. From the outer edge of this the skull
appears as though beveled away to the ears, giving the temporal area a considerable
enlargement beyond that usually shown. This curious development
of the skull is rendered still more striking by the fact that the bridge of the
nose is low, as usual among these people, so that the shelf-like projection of
the brow stands out in strong relief. It is most strongly marked among the
men and appears to be characteristic at this place. Elsewhere in this district
it was noted only rarely here and there.</p>

<p>All of the people in the district about Capes Vancouver and Romanzof, and
thence to the Yukon mouth, are of unusually light complexion. Some of the
women have a pale, slightly yellowish color, with pink cheeks, differing but
little in complexion from that of a sallow woman of Caucasian blood. This
light complexion is so exceptionally striking that wherever they travel these
people are readily distinguished from other Eskimo, and before I visited their
territory I had learned to know them by their complexion whenever they came
to St. Michael.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<p>The people of the district just mentioned are all very short and squarely
built. Inland from Cape Vancouver lies the flat marshy country about Big
Lake, which is situated between the Kuskokwim and the Yukon. It is a
well-populated district and its inhabitants differ from those near the coast
at the capes referred to, in being taller, more slender, and having more
squarely cut features. They also differ strikingly from any other Eskimo
with whom I came in contact, except those on Kowak River, in having the
bridge of the nose well developed and at times sufficiently prominent to suggest
the aquiline nose of our southern Indian tribes.</p>

<p>The Eskimo of the Diomede Islands in Bering Strait, as well as those of
East Cape and Mechigme and Plover Bays on the Siberian coast, and of St.
Lawrence Island are tall, strongly built people and are generally similar in
their physical features. These are characterized by the unusual heaviness of
the lower part of the face due to the very square and massive lower jaw, which,
combined with broad, high cheek bones and flattened nose, produces a wide,
flat face. These features are frequently accompanied with a low retreating
forehead, producing a decidedly repulsive physiognomy. The bridge of the nose
is so low and the cheek bones so heavy that a profile view will frequently show
only the tip of the person's nose, the eyes and upper portion of the nose being
completely hidden by the prominent outline of the cheek. Their eyes are less
oblique than is common among the people living southward from the Yukon
mouth. Among the people at the northwestern end of St. Lawrence Island
there is a greater range of physiognomy than was noted at any other of the
Asiatic localities.</p>

<p>The Point Hope people on the American coast have heavy jaws and well-developed
superciliary ridges. At Point Barrow the men are remarkable for
the irregularity of their features, amounting to a positive degree of ugliness,
which is increased and rendered specially prominent by the expression produced
by the short, tightly drawn upper lip, the projecting lower lip, and the small
beady eyes. The women and children of this place are in curious contrast,
having rather pleasant features of the usual type.</p>

<p>The Eskimo from Upper Kowak and Noatak Rivers who were met at the
summer camp on Hotham Inlet are notable for the fact that a considerable
number of them have hook noses and nearly all have a cast of countenance
very similar to that of the Yukon Tienné. They are a larger and more robustly
built people than these Indians, however, and speak the Eskimo language.
They wear labrets, practice the tonsure, and claim to be Eskimo. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Among them was seen one man having a mop of coarse curly hair, almost
negroid in character. The same feature was observed in a number of men and
women on the Siberian coast between East Cape and Plover Bay. This latter
is undoubtedly the result of the Chukchi-Eskimo mixture, and in the case of
the man seen at Hotham Inlet the same result had been brought about by the
Eskimo-Indian combination. Among the Eskimo south of Bering Strait on the
American coast not a single instance of this kind was observed. The age of
the individuals having this curly hair renders it quite improbable that it came
from an admixture of blood with foreign voyagers, since some of them must
have been born at a time when vessels were extremely rare along these shores.
As a further argument against this curly hair having come from white men,
I may add that I saw no trace of it among a number of people having partly
Caucasian blood. As a general thing, the Eskimo of the region described, have
small hands and feet and the features are oval in outline, rather flat and with
slightly oblique eyes.</p>

<p>Children and young girls have round faces and often are very pleasant and
attractive in feature, the angular race characteristics becoming prominent after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the individuals approach manhood. The women age rapidly, and only a very
small proportion of the people live to an advanced age.</p>

<p>The Malemut and the people of Kaviak Peninsula, including those of the
islands in Bering Strait are tall, active, and remarkably well built. Among
them it is common to see men from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall and of proportionate
build. I should judge the average among them to be nearly or quite
equal in height to the whites.</p>

<p>Among the coast Eskimos, as a rule, the legs are short and poorly developed,
while the body is long with disproportionately developed dorsal and lumbar
muscles, due to so much of their life being passed in the kaiak.</p>

<p>The Eskimo of the Big Lake district, south of the Yukon, and from the Kaviak
Peninsula, as well as the Malemut about the head of Kotzebue Sound, are on
the contrary very finely proportioned and athletic men who can not be equaled
among the Indians of the Yukon region. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* There were a number of
half-blood children among the Eskimo, resulting from the intercourse with
people from vessels and others, who generally show their Caucasian blood by
large, finely shaped, and often remarkably beautiful brown eyes. The number
of these mixed bloods was not very great.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Eskimos of Alaska are a much finer race physically than their kindred
of Greenland and Labrador. In the extreme north, at Point Barrow, and
along the coast of Bering Sea they are of medium size. At Point Barrow the
average height of the males is 5 feet 3 inches and average weight 153 pounds;
of the women, 4 feet 11 inches and weight 135 pounds. On the Nushagak
River the average weight of the men is from 150 to 167 pounds. From Cape
Prince of Wales to Icy Cape along the Arctic Coast and on the great inland
rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean they are a large race, many of them
being 6 feet and over in height.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> They are lighter in color and fairer than
the North American Indian, have black and brown eyes, black hair, some
with a tinge of brown, high cheek bones, fleshy faces, small hands and feet,
and good teeth. The men have thin beards.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Alaskan Eskimo are a taller and more symmetrical people than their
brethren of the central and eastern districts. They lack that appearance of
stoutness and squatness inherent in the eastern stock, and for proportion and
development of the various parts of the body they do not compare unfavorably
with Indians and whites. It is not unusual to find in an Alaskan Eskimo
village several men who are 6 feet tall, with magnificent shoulders and arms
and bodily strength in proportion. The usual height, however, is about 168
centimeters for men, which is some 10 centimeters above the height of the
eastern Eskimo. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The average for women among the western Eskimo
is 158 centimeters, which approximates the height of the men in the Hudson
Bay region, 158 centimeters (Boas). The female type in Alaska is taller and
slimmer than in the east, and the width of the face is considerably less.
Eskimo women of large stature are often seen in the northern section of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>Alaska. The individual variation here is more conspicuous than in Labrador
or Hudson Bay.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Older Anthropometric Data on the Western Eskimo</span></h3>


<h4>STATURE AND OTHER MEASUREMENTS ON THE LIVING</h4>

<p>The earliest actual measurements of the living among the western
Eskimo are those given in Captain Beechey's Narrative (1832, p.
226), where we read that of the Eskimo of Cape Thompson (north of
Kotzebue Sound) "the tallest man was 5 feet 9 inches (175.3 centimeters),
the tallest woman 5 feet 4 inches (162.6 centimeters) in
height." As seen before, Beechey also stated that the stature of the
Eskimo increases from the east to the west.</p>

<p>In 1881-82, Lieutenant Ray collects and in 1885 reports evidently
careful measurements of 51 men and 30 women from the villages of
Uglaamie, at Cape Smythe, now Barrow, and Nuwuk, on Point
Barrow.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> An abstract of the data shows as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Average height: Male, 5 feet 3½ inches (161.3 centimeters); female, 4 feet 11¾ inches (151.8 centimeters).</li>
<li>Average weight: Male, 153⅗ pounds; female, 135⅔ pounds.</li>
<li>Tallest male: 5 feet 8¾ inches (174.6 centimeters).</li>
<li>Tallest female: 5 feet 3 inches (160 centimeters).</li>
<li>Shortest male: 4 feet 11 inches (149.9 centimeters).</li>
<li>Shortest female: 4 feet ½ inch (123.2 centimeters).</li>
<li>Weight: Male, 126 to 204 pounds; female, 106 to 172 pounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1892, in connection with the preparation of the anthropological
exhibits for the World Exposition at Chicago, an extensive effort was
made under the direction of Frederick W. Putnam and Franz Boas
to secure, by the help of a group of specially instructed students,
physical data on many tribes of the American aborigines, and this
included a contingent of the western Eskimo. An abstract of the
results was reported by Boas in 1895.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The locality where the
Eskimo were measured is not given, but it was most likely Nome
or St. Michael Island. Thirty-four men gave the high (for the
Eskimo) average of 165.8 centimeters, an unstated number of
women an equally elevated average of 155.1 centimeters. No details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>are given. There is also given the mean and distribution of the
cephalic index on 114 living western Eskimo of both sexes. (On
chart, p. 395, the number is 141.) The mean index was 79.2. There
are again, as under Stature, no details as to locality, and none
could be obtained from the author.</p>

<p>In 1901 Deniker, in his Races of Man (p. 580), reports the stature
of 85 Eskimo of Alaska, doubtless males, as 163 centimeters.
There are no details, no references, and I have not been able to trace
the source of the measurement.</p>

<p>During the years 1897-1899 A. J. Stone made an extended journey
along a portion of the upper Yukon and through parts of
northwestern Alaska and the Mackenzie River basin, for the American
Museum of Natural History. On this journey he made some
measurements of Indian and Eskimo, and these were published in
1901 by Franz Boas.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The Eskimo measured were the "Nunatagmiut"
(11 males, 5 females), of the Noatak River, Alaska, and the
"Koukpagmiut," (12 males, 6 females), east of the mouth of the
Mackenzie. The Noataks, who alone interest us more closely here,
gave the relatively high (for Eskimo) stature of 167.9 centimeters in
the men and 155.6 centimeters in the women. The number of subjects
is small and there may possibly have been some unconscious selection;
yet it is clear that in this group there are numerous fairly tall
individuals.</p>

<h4>THE SKULL</h4>

<p>The first western Eskimo skull collected for scientific purposes
was apparently that of a female St. Lawrence Islander. It was
taken from the rocks of the island by the Kotzebue party in 1817.
It was reported upon phrenologically in 1822 by Gall.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In 1839 Morton, in his "Crania Americana" (p. 248), gives
measurements and the illustration of a western Eskimo skull from
Icy Cape, collected by Dr. A. Collie, surgeon of H. M. S. <em>Blossom</em>.
The principal measurements of this evidently female skull were:
Length, 17.02 centimeters; breadth, 12.70; height, 12.70. Cephalic
index, <em>74.6</em>.</p>

<p>In 1862<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and 1863<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Daniel Wilson reports briefly on six
Tchuktchi skulls, which were probably those of Asiatic Eskimo. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My opportunities for examining Esquimaux crania have been sufficient to
furnish me with very satisfactory data for forming an opinion on the true
Arctic skull form. In addition to the measurements of 38 skulls, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I have recently compared and carefully measured six Tchuktchi [probably
Asiatic coast Eskimo] skulls, in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution,
exhumed from the burial place of a village called Tergnyune, on the island of
Arikamcheche, at Glassnappe Harbor, west of Bering Strait, and during a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>recent visit to Philadelphia I enjoyed the advantage of examining, in company
with Dr. J. Aitken Meigs, a series of 125 [eastern] Esquimaux crania, obtained
by Doctor Hayes during his Arctic journey of 1860. The comparison
between the Tchuktchi and the true Esquimaux skull is interesting. Without
being identical, the correspondence in form is such as their languages and
other affinities would suggest. Of the former, moreover, the number is too
few, and the derivation of all of them from one cemetery adds to the chances
of exceptional family features; but on carefully examining the Hayes collection
with a view to this comparison, I found it was quite possible to select
an equal number of Esquimaux crania closely corresponding to the Tchuktchi
type, which indeed presents the most prominent characteristics of the former,
only less strongly marked.</p></div>

<p>In Prehistoric Man, Volume II, Plate XV, this author gives also
the measurements of the Icy Cape skull recorded by Morton.</p>

<p>The principal mean measurements of the six Tchuktchi skulls (both
sexes) were: Height, 17.60 centimeters; breadth, 13.59; height, 13.77;
cranial index, <em>77.2</em>.</p>

<p>The next measurements on western Eskimo crania are those given
in 1867 by J. Barnard Davis (<em>Thes. cran.</em>). This author measured 6
skulls, 3 of which were from Port Clarence (Seward Peninsula),
2 from Kotzebue Sound, and 1 from Cape Lisburne. The measurements,
regrettably, are in inches. They include the greatest glabello-occipital
length, greatest breadth, height (plane of for. magn. to
vertex), height of face (chin-nasion), and breadth of face (d. bizygom.
max.). The cranial index of the 4 specimens identified as
male averaged <em>75.5</em> (75-76), that of the 2 females <em>77.5</em> (77-78). On
page <a href="#Page_226">226</a> the author mentions also an artificially deformed skull
of a Koniag; this was in all probability a wrong identification for
no such deformations are known from the island (Kodiak).</p>

<p>In 1868 Jeffries Wyman<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> published measurements of 5 skulls of
"Tsuktshi," the same as those of Daniel Wilson, and of 5 from the
Yukon River, "three of which are Mahlemuts."</p>

<p>The identification of the specimens was partly erroneous. The
data with corrected identification are republished by Dall (q. v.) in
1877. And the same skulls figure in all future measurements.</p>

<p>In 1875 Topinard<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> gives the Barnard Davis measurements in
metric form without, so far as the western Eskimo are concerned,
any additions.</p>

<p>The main measurements of Barnard Davis's western Eskimo skulls,
converted to metric values, follow. The sex identification in some
of the specimens is doubtful.</p>

<p>The next records are those by George A. Otis, published in 1876
in the Check List of the Specimens in the Section of Anatomy of the
United States Army Medical Museum, Washington (pp. 13-15).
Aside from those on Greenland crania the author gives here the measurements
of 3 presumably Eskimo skulls collected by Dall; of 2
western Eskimo skulls, no locality; and of 3 Mahlemut skulls, probably
from Norton Sound (St. Michael Island). In his later (1880)
catalogue,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> page 13, Otis adds to the above three skulls from Prince
William Sound, which, however, were more probably Indian; the
three Mahlemuts, on the other hand, are given with the Alaskan
Indians (p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>). These data are of but little value. The Eskimo
skulls are the same Smithsonian specimens that were reported upon
in 1868 by Jeffries Wyman.</p>

<p>In 1878, Rae<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> mentions some measurements or observations on
the skulls of Western Eskimo by Flower, but no records of these
could be located. Rae says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had the privilege of attending the series of admirable lectures so ably
given by Professor Flower at the Royal College of Surgeons a few weeks ago
on the "Comparative Anatomy of Man," from which I derived much useful
information and on one point very considerable food for thought.</p>

<p>I allude to the wonderful difference in form exhibited between the skulls of
the Eskimos from the neighborhood of Bering Strait, and of those inhabiting
Greenland, the latter being extremely dolichocephalic, whilst the former are
the very opposite&mdash;brachycephalic, the natives of the intermediate coast, from
the Coppermine River eastward, having mesocephalic heads.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1879 Lucien Carr, in his "Observations on the Crania from the
Santa Barbara Islands, California"<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> (p. 281), gives erroneously
Otis's measurements of Aleut skulls as those of "Alaskan Eskimo."</p>

<p>Meanwhile W. H. Dall has published (1877) his monograph on
the "Tribes of the Extreme Northwest,"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> in which he includes
Wyman's and also some of Otis's data on the Eskimo (and Aleut)
skulls from Alaska and Asia. The Tshuktshi are now classed as
Asiatic Eskimo, the Mahlemuts as Eskimo from St. Michael Island.
The total number of skulls described in the former series is 11, in
the latter series 6 (of Aleuts the number of skulls measured is 27
adults and 7 children). The means of the principal measurements
of the Eskimo series, both sexes together, are as follows:</p>

<p>There were also taken the weight, capacity, circumference, longitudinal
arch, length of the frontal, parietal, and occipital, "zygomatic
diameter," and in two specimens of each series the facial
angle. To-day these data have but a historical value.</p>

<p>In 1882, Quatrefages and Hamy,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> in their "Crania ethnica"

<p>In 1883 Dr. Irving C. Rosse, in his "Medical and Anthropological
Notes on Alaska,"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> refers to his examination of a number of Eskimo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>skulls from the St. Lawrence Island brought to the Army Medical
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> There are no measurements outside of a reference to the
capacity, but there are two excellent chromolithographs showing two
female crania, besides a number of outline drawings.</p>

<p>The next data on the western Eskimo skull are in rather unsatisfactory
condition. They are those of Boas. In his report on the "Anthropologie
der nordamerikanischen Indianer,"<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Doctor Boas mentions
the cranial index of the Alaska Eskimo to average <em>77</em>; and on
page 397 he reports the same index as secured on 37 "Alaska Eskimo"
skulls, apparently of both sexes. The only note relating to these
figures is found on page 393, where it is stated that these results
proceed from measurements that had been made for the author at
the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, the American Museum, New York,
the Academy of Sciences, Philadelphia, and the United States Army
Medical Museum, Washington; and that he utilized also the measurements
of Barnard Davis and Otis. On 22 of the above western
Eskimo skulls there is also given the length-height index of <em>76.6</em>.
There is no information as to either sex or locality. There are no
other measurements.</p>

<p>Deniker (1901) and later Martin (1914) repeat the data given by
Boas.</p>

<p>In 1900 Sergi<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> reports on four Kodiak skulls that he examined in
Paris. Two of these are probably Aleut (or Indian). The cranial
indices were, respectively, <em>75.8</em>, <em>78.3</em>, <em>88</em>, and <em>88.2</em>.</p>

<p>In 1916 E. W. Hawkes presented a thesis on the "Skeletal Measurements
and Observations on the Point Barrow Eskimo, with Comparisons
from other Eskimo Groups."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The number of skulls measured
was 27, of which 14 were identified as adult males, 5 adult females, 6
adolescents, and 2 infants. In addition there are measurements by
Ralph Linton of other skeletal parts than the skull of three skeletons.</p>

<p>The measurements, though the first taken by this author, have evidently
been taken in a painstaking manner and according to modern
methods, and are therefore of some value. An abstract of those on
the adults follows:</p>

<p>The last contribution to the craniology of the western Eskimo
before the present report are the data embodied in my "Catalogue
of Human Crania in the United States National Museum Collections,"
published in 1924.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> These data are embodied in those of the

<p>For ready survey the old records on western Eskimo crania are
given in the following table. A sex distinction in the earlier reports
was mostly impracticable or remained doubtful.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Present Data on the Western Eskimo</span></h3>


<h4>THE LIVING</h4>

<p>Barring the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands in the south and the
Chukchee territory in the west, the Bering Sea is wholly the sea of
the Eskimo, the Indians occupying the inland but reaching nowhere
to the coast. There is doubtless much of significance in this remarkable
distribution. It is now quite certain that the Eskimo has not
been pressed out by the Indian; there are as a rule no traces of him
farther inland than where he has been within historic times. On
the other hand no Indian remnants or remains are known from
any part of the coasts or islands within the Eskimo region; though
the study of the older sites in these regions has barely as yet begun,
besides which (see Narrative) it is a serious question whether really
old sites could now be located in these regions at all even if they had
once existed. At all events the Eskimo appears from all indications
to be the latest comer, and judging from his remains his occupancy
here is not geologically ancient; it is one to be counted, apparently, in
many hundreds of years rather than in thousands. The Aleuts in the
south are, as I have pointed out in the Catalogue (No. 1, 1924, p. 39),
not Eskimo but Indians, related to the general Alaska Indian type;
and the Pribilof Islands appear never to have been occupied until
fairly recently, when a good number of Aleuts, mostly mixed bloods,
have been transported and established there in the interest of the
seal fisheries.</p>


<h4>MEASUREMENTS OF LIVING WESTERN ESKIMO</h4>

<p>Thanks to Moore, Collins, and Stewart, all of the National
Museum, instructed by me and working with the same instruments,
we now have several small to fair series of measurements on
the living western Eskimo of both sexes. They are tabulated below.
They are the first made on these groups and will be of much interest
both in general and in connection with the measurements made on the
skulls and bones of most of the same people. The main points shown
are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Stature.</em>&mdash;The stature of the males ranges from markedly to moderately
submedium. There is a considerable similarity. Only the
Yukon group and that of Togiak reach near or slightly above medium,
the general human medium for males approaching 165 centimeters.
The female stature on the St. Lawrence Island averages 12
centimeters less than that of the males, which is about the difference
found in most other peoples. At Hooper Bay, and especially at the
Nunivak Island, the difference is less, indicating either that the males
are slightly stunted or that the growth of the females is somewhat
favored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Height sitting.</em>&mdash;The height-sitting-stature index ranges from
slightly to quite notably higher than it is in other races, indicating
a tendency toward a relatively long trunk and somewhat short limbs.
A study of the long bones shows that this is due especially, if not
wholly, to the relative shortness of the tibia; and the subdevelopment
of this bone may, it seems, be ascribed to a great deal of squatting
both at home during the long winters and in the canoes. The male
Eskimo show more difference from other males in this respect than
the Eskimo females show from other females.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><em>Arm span.</em>&mdash;Relatively to the stature the length of the arms in the
Eskimo males is shorter than it is in other racial groups, though there
appears to be some inequality in this respect. This shortness would
be especially marked if we compared the arm span with the height
sitting. It is due essentially to a shortness of the distal half of the
upper limbs. The males once more show this disproportion more
as compared to other males than the females compared with others
of their sex. (See comp. data in Old Americans.) This may be
connected in some way with the male Eskimo work and habits; or it
may be an expression of a correlative subdevelopment with that of the
lower limbs. It is a good point for further study.</p>

<p><em>The head.</em>&mdash;The head, especially when taken in relation to the
stature, is of good size, particularly on the Nunivak Island and on the
Yukon. This agrees with what is known of the Eskimo head, skull,
and brain elsewhere.</p>

<p>The size of the Eskimo head&mdash;which is not caused by a thick skull&mdash;will
best be appreciated by contrasting it with that of civilized whites.
In whites in general the mean head diameter or cephalic module
ranges in males from approximately 15.70 to 16.40; in the male western
Eskimo groups the range is 15.87 to 16.08, and 16.11 in the group
at Marshall on the Yukon. The percentage relation of the module to
stature in 12 groups of male whites, including the old Americans,
averages <em>9.31</em> to <em>10.11</em>; in the male Eskimo groups it is from <em>9.57</em> to
<em>9.94</em>. In females, the cephalic module is 15.57 in the old Americans,
15.36 to 15.68 in the Eskimo; the relation of the module to stature in
the former being <em>9.59</em>, in the latter <em>10.15</em> to <em>10.25</em>.</p>

<p>In the western Eskimo woman the head dimensions are particularly
favorable. In the old American whites the mean head diameter
in the female is to that of the male on the average as <em>95</em> to 100; in
the two main groups of the western Eskimo it is as <em>96.1</em> and <em>96.7</em> to
100. Nothing is known as to the cause of this apparently favorable
status of the Eskimo woman; it is another interesting point for
further inquiry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>
<p>In shape, the head of the western Eskimo is highly mesocephalic
to moderately brachycephalic and of only fair height, and it seldom
approaches the scaphoid or dome-shaped. It is not the narrow, high,
keeled skull of the northeastern and often the northern Eskimo.
The physiognomy, the characteristics of the body, and the mentality
and behavior, are in general typical Eskimo; but the form of the
vault is substantially different. It is a form which approaches on
one side that of the northwesternmost Indian, and on the other that of
the northeastern and Mongoloid Asiatics. More must be said about
this when we come to consider the skull.</p>

<p><em>The forehead.</em>&mdash;Anthropometric studies have shown repeatedly<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
that the height of the forehead is not a safe gauge of intelligence,
as commonly believed, but is controlled by the variable height of
the hair line. Thus the common full-blood American Negro
laborer and servant show a slightly higher forehead than the educated
old American whites.</p>

<p>Something of a similar nature is found in the Eskimo. As seen
in the following table, in the males the western Eskimo forehead is
absolutely, and especially relatively to stature, higher than it is in
the whites. In the females the absolute height in the two races is
identical, but relatively to stature the Eskimo again shows a clear
though somewhat lesser advantage. The condition is apparently not
due to the size of the head, for this is not greater than in the whites,
in the males; while in the females, where the Eskimo shows a
slightly larger head than the white in relation to stature, the forehead
fails to correspond.</p>

<p>With the lower breadth of the forehead, conditions are also interesting.
The absolute figures for the two races show a reversal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
The height of the forehead is larger in the Eskimo than in the white
males, equal in the females; the lower frontal breadth is equal in the
males but larger in the Eskimo than in the white female. Proportionately
to stature, which is so much lower in the Eskimo, both sexes
of the latter show an advantage in the dimension over the white.</p>

<p>The percental relation of the breadth of the forehead to that of
the face reflects the excess of the latter in the Eskimo, particularly
the male. There is evidently not a full direct correlation between
the two dimensions. Yet relatively to its height the face is broader
in the females than in the males (see below), which is doubtless
not without influence on the lower breadth of the forehead in the
former.</p>

<p>To summarize, the western Eskimo forehead exceeds in area that
of the American whites, in both sexes, and that particularly in relation
to stature. As to the individual measurements, the male Eskimo
forehead as contrasted with that of the white is especially high, the
female especially broad.</p>

<p>To which should be added that in the Eskimo the spheno-temporal
region is often remarkably full, almost bulging, so that, contrary
to what may be observed in the Negro, the frontal maximum
diameter is also probably larger than in the whites, all of which
doubtless has significance, even though this is not yet fully understood.</p>

<p><em>The face.</em>&mdash;The principal measurements and relations are given
below. They show a face large and especially broad. Moreover,
relatively to its height the face is especially broad in the Eskimo
female, in connection doubtless with the well-known excess of the
work (in softening leather, etc.) of her jaws, with consequent development
of the muscles of mastication, which in turn broaden the
zygoma.</p>

<p>The great size of the Eskimo face is especially apparent in the
relations of the mean diameter of the face to stature; it is in this
respect no less than 12 per cent in excess of that of the whites in the
males and 12.5 per cent in the females.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><em>Lower facial breadth.</em>&mdash;Due to the great development of the masseter
muscles and the consequent frequent lesser or greater eversion
of the angles of the lower jaw, the bigonial diameter in the Eskimo
is very large, particularly when taken in relation to stature, and in
such relation it looms especially large in the females. Compared
with the old American whites, the bigonial breadth in its relation to
stature is higher in the Eskimo males by 15.5 per cent, in the Eskimo
females by 17.7 per cent. And measurements of Eskimo lower jaws
in general show that this breadth in the western contingents is not
exceptional.</p>

<p><em>The nose.</em>&mdash;The nose of the western Eskimo promises to be of
much importance in the study of Eskimo origins in general. Nowhere
in this region is it like the nose of the northern or northeastern
groups. It is decidedly broader. Its breadth is intermediary
between that of the Alaska and other Indians and that of the northern
and northeastern Eskimo, connecting with both, and these characteristics
are so generalized throughout western Alaska and the Bering
Sea islands that they can not possibly be attributed to Indian or
other admixture. Nor can this relatively broad nose of the western
Eskimo be well attributed to environmental effects, i. e., to a broadening
of a formerly narrow nose through climatic conditions. There
do not appear to be any such conditions. The only rational explanation
seems to be that this is the more original condition of the
Eskimo nose, and that the northern and northeastern narrowness
is a later derivation. More may be said on this point when we
come to consider the skeletal remains.</p>

<p>The Eskimo nose is also high, which goes with the height of the
whole face; that in turn evidently is attributable to more work and
demand&mdash;in brief, more mastication. The nose, face, lower jaw, and
other parts of the Eskimo anatomy offer rare opportunities for
studies in the heredity of acquired characters.</p>

especially long. They exceed in both size and relative length those
of whites, but are in both respects much more like those of the
American Indian. The excess in length, both in the Eskimo and
the Indian, is especially marked when this measurement is taken in

<p>Relatively to its length, the ear of the female Eskimo in all our
groups is somewhat narrow, giving a lower index. This is not
observed in the available whites and Indians.</p>

<p><em>The chest.</em>&mdash;The best measurements of the chest, experience has
shown, are the antero-posterior and lateral diameters at the nipple
height in the males and at the corresponding level of the upper border
of the fourth costal cartilages in the females. They give not merely
the individual dimensions but also their relation, which is of much
ontogenic as well as other interest, and their mean gives the chest
module which in relation to the stature is anthropologically as well as
individually (medically) important.</p>

<p>The table following gives the chest measurements in the western
Eskimo, in a large group of Indians (my older data), and in the old
American whites as well as others.</p>

<p>The Eskimo chest is large. In the males, in addition, it is very
deep. Compared to that of the white old Americans it is markedly
deeper in the males and broader in the females, notwithstanding the
fact that the Americans are much taller. It is even larger, besides
being relatively deeper in the males and somewhat broader in the
females, than it is in many tribes of the Indian. Only tall and
bulky Indians such as the Sioux show a chest that is absolutely
somewhat larger, but in relation to stature, with which the dimensions
of the chest stand in close correlation,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the Eskimo prevails
even in this instance. This excess in chest development in the Eskimo
must be ascribed in the main to his occupations and exertions, particularly
again, it would seem, in connection with the canoe.</p>

<p><em>The foot.</em>&mdash;The foot of the western Eskimo, like his hand, is both
absolutely and relatively to stature rather short, but it is broad,
giving a high breadth-length index. Its actual breadth perceptibly
exceeds that of the much taller old American whites, though not
reaching that of any of the immigrant laborers.</p>

<p>Contrary to what was seen in the case of the hand, the relative
proportions of the Eskimo foot, as expressed by the index, are almost
identical with those of the southwestern and Mexican Indians. The
Sioux foot is relatively longer, and so is that of whites except
southern Italians, who, though their foot as a whole is larger, give
the same index as the Eskimo.</p>

<p><em>Girth of the calf.</em>&mdash;The western Eskimo, like the American Indians,
are characterized by a rather slender calf. The size of the
calf correlates in a large measure with stature. Reducing our measurements
to calf girth-stature ratios, these are seen to be much alike
in the three racial groups used for comparison, namely the Eskimo,
the Indian, and the old American white. But this is deceptive.
The correlation of size of calf with stature is not uniform (see "Old
Americans," p. 348) for all stature groups; as the scale in stature
descends the calf is relatively stouter. If we take white Americans
of approximately the same stature with the Eskimo here considered,
there appears a higher ratio, showing that stature for stature the
girth of the calf of the Eskimo is smaller, notwithstanding his generally
more ample supply of adipose tissue. Once more his relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
is closer with the Indian. The Eskimo and the Indian women
are especially much alike, while the white women make a marked
exception&mdash;their calfs (as well as thighs) have more fat than is
found in those of their Eskimo and Indian sisters.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Physiological Observations</span></h3>

<p>Due to various difficulties which do not exist to that extent elsewhere,
the physiological observations on the Eskimo are neither as numerous
or extended as would be desirable; yet there are some data of value.
They extend to the pulse, respiration, temperature, and dynamometric
tests of hand pressure. They were made mainly on St. Lawrence
and Nunivak Islands, by Moore, Collins, and Stewart. They
quite agree, especially after elimination of some records that are
clearly erroneous or abnormal. The tests should be extended with
even more rigid precautions in future work among the Eskimo.</p>

<p>The results are given below. They were all made in the summer
season and on healthy subjects, yet there were numerous indications
of temporary disorders, pathological or functional. Even after a
careful elimination of the obvious cases of such disorders not a few
minor irregularities have doubtless remained, so that the data can
not be taken for more than fairly close approximations to the normal.</p>

<p>The data show remarkably low pulse, respiration rate and temperature
close to those of whites, with a submedium hand pressure.
(For comparative data see "Old Americans.") The low pulse is
also characteristic in the Indian, as I have repeatedly pointed out
before (see especially my "Physiological and Medical Observations
among the Indians," etc., Bull. 34, Bur. Amer. Ethn., Washington,
1908).</p>

<p>The dynamometric tests agree also better with those on the Indians
than with those on whites; they are valid only as to the hands, and
they embody not only the strength of the muscles but also that of the
conscious impulse behind them. The age factor, of importance, does
not here enter materially into the case.</p>

<p>In connection with the pressure tests in the two hands, some interesting
comparisons are possible between the Eskimo here dealt with
and the old white Americans. As all the tests were made with the
same instrument and method the results inspire confidence. It is in
details of this nature that the anthropologist finds again and again
the most striking proofs of the basal unity of the living races and
their necessarily common origin somewhere in the past.</p>

<p>These Eskimo are generally of submedium stature, occasionally
reaching medium. The distal parts of their extremities are relatively
short. Walk in adult males somewhat awkward.</p>

<p>In head form they are highly mesocephalic to moderately brachycephalic;
the height of the head averages about medium. The
head is of good size, especially when taken in relation to stature.
The forehead is above medium in both height and breadth.</p>

<p>The face is large in all dimensions, generally full and rather
flat. In men it not seldom approaches a square form. The lower
jaw region is largely developed, the angles of the lower jaw are
broad to protruding.</p>

<p>The nose is of fair breadth, with bridge somewhat narrow above
and on the whole only moderately high. The mouth is large, lips
medium to somewhat above. The ears are long. Beard spare on
sides of face, mostly sparse on chin; mustache sparse and often limited
to tufts above the corners of the mouth. Expression generally good-natured,
smiling.</p>

<p>The chest is large, in females broad, in males especially deep.
There is but a mild lumbar curve and no steatopygy. The lower
limbs in females are less stout and shapely than they are in whites.
The hands and feet are small, but, particularly the foot, relatively
broad.</p>

<p>Temperature and respiration approach those in normal whites,
though they appear frequently to be slightly higher; pulse normally is
slow.</p>

<p>Dynamometric tests of strength (pressure, both hands) give somewhat
lower records than in whites.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Remarks</span></h3>

<p>The most noteworthy and important result of these studies on
the living western Eskimo is the evidence, coming to light again
and again, of their fundamental somatic relations to the Indian.
These relations are too numerous and weighty to be accidental. Nor
can they be ascribed to mixture with the Indian in such far-away
groups as the St. Lawrence Islanders, who so long as known have
never had any direct or even indirect contact with Indians. These
relations in dimensions and relative proportions of the body, and
in physiological characteristics such as the slow normal pulse, are
supplemented by many phases of behavior, and often by a more or
less Indianlike physiognomy. They inevitably lead to the conclusion
that the Eskimo and the Indian are in the root members of
the same family. They are two digits of the same hand, separate
and diverging, yet at base joined to and derived from the same
source. And this source, according to many indications, is the
paleo-asiatic, "mongoloid," stem of northern Asia. The western
Eskimo shows to be nearer this source than his more northern and
northeastern relatives, indicating either that he is a later comer, or,
which is more probable, that he has changed less in the south than
in the north. It may be possible to say something more on this
subject after the skeletal remains have been considered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Present Data on the Skull and other Skeletal Remains of the
Western Eskimo</span></h3>


<h4>THE SKULL</h4>

<p>Until recently collections of skeletal remains of the western Eskimo
were confined largely to skulls. The material in our own institutions
comprised a small collection of Mahlemut (St. Michael Island) and
"Chukchee" (Asiatic Eskimo) crania made in the early sixties by
W. H. Dall; a larger series of crania gathered in 1881 on St. Michael
and St. Lawrence Islands by E. W. Nelson; 28 skulls with 3 skeletons
brought in 1898 by E. A. McIlheny from Point Barrow; a valuable
lot of skulls from Indian Point, Siberia, with a few from St.
Lawrence Island, collected by W. Bogoras; and some scattered specimens
by other explorers. To this were added in 1912 an important
collection of skulls, with a few skeletons, made by Riley D. Moore, at
that time my aide, on St. Lawrence Island; an important lot of crania
gathered a few years later by V. Stefánsson at Point Barrow; and a
third large and highly interesting lot, this time of both skulls and
skeletons, collected near Barrow for the University Museum at Philadelphia
in 1917-1919 by W. B. Van Valin. But none of the later material
was described excepting the McIlheny collection which, in 1916,
was reported upon by E. W. Hawkes.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>During the survey which is the subject of this report a special
effort was made to collect all the older skeletal material along the
Bering Sea and Arctic coasts that could be reached, and the result
was the bringing back of some 450 crania, nearly 50 with skeletons,
and many separate parts of the skeleton; nearly all of the specimens
proceeding from localities thus far not represented in the collections.
To which were added in 1927 nearly 200 skulls with a good number
of skeletons gathered by H. B. Collins, jr., assistant curator in the Department
of Anthropology, United States National Museum, and my
aide, T. D. Stewart, on Nunivak Island and along the west coast of
Alaska from Bristol Bay to near the Yukon delta.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>We thus have now a relatively vast amount of skeletal material on
the western Eskimo; it is essentially a virginal material; it is well
identified as to locality; and the specimens are mostly in very good
condition.</p>

<p>Aside from Hawkes's thesis, nothing of note had been published
on these collections until 1924, when the first number of my Catalogue
of Human Crania in the United States National Museum Collections
appeared, which includes the principal measurements on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>290 skulls of the western Eskimo. Since then, in view of the growing
importance of the subject, I have remeasured every specimen
reported before; have measured personally all the new collections;
and thanks to the kindness of those in charge have been enabled to
extend the measurements to all the collections of Eskimo crania,
both from Alaska and elsewhere, that were preserved up to the
spring of 1928 at the National Museum at Ottawa, the American
Museum of Natural History of New York, and the Wistar Institute
of Philadelphia, which now contains the University Museum collections.
The total records reach now to 1,283 adult skulls from practically
all important parts of the total Eskimo area, besides a considerable
quantity of other bones of the skeleton. The main results
of the work will be given here, the detailed measurements being reserved
for another number of the Catalogue.</p>

<p>To save repetitions and possible confusion and to show more clearly
the status of the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo, the entire
cranial material will be dealt with in this section, and previous
records on the northeastern and a few other groups of the Eskimo
will not be drawn upon to preserve the advantage of dealing with
data obtained by the same methods, instruments, and observer.</p>

<p>In presenting the records it is found expedient, both on geographical
and anthropological grounds, to make but three groupings.
The first of these comprises the Eskimo from their southernmost
limit to Norton Sound and the Bering Sea islands; the second group
takes in Seward Peninsula (or the larger part of it) and the Arctic
coast to Point Barrow; while the third embraces all the Eskimo
east of Point Barrow. The first of these three groups is remarkably
homogeneous, the second and third show each some exceptional units.
It may be said at once that the dialectic subdivisions of Dall,
Nelson, and others, in a large majority of cases are not found to be
accompanied by corresponding physical differences, so that in a
somatological classification they become submerged.</p>

<h4>SKULL SIZE</h4>

<p>The external size of the skull is best expressed by the cranial
module or mean of the three principal diameters; the internal size,
respectively the volume of the brain, by the "cranial capacity."</p>

<p>The module among the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo averages
15.44 centimeters in the males and 14.77 centimeters in the females.
For people of submedium stature these are good dimensions.
Fifty-two male and 40 female skulls of the much taller Sioux (writer's
unpublished data) give the modules of only 15.25 and 14.27 centimeters;
while 6 male and 9 female Munsee Indians, also tall,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>practically the same values as these Eskimos, namely 15.48 centimeters
for the males and 14.75 centimeters for the females.</p>

<p>Not all the western groups, however, give equally favorable proportions.
In general, the coast people below Norton Sound, and
especially below the Yukon, give, so far as the males are concerned,
the lowest values. It is interesting to note that it is precisely these
people who among the western Eskimo are reputed to be about
the lowest also in culture. The Togiak and near-by Kulukak males
showed, as seen before, also about the smallest head in the living.
The St. Lawrence Island males stand just about the middle, but
the females of this island, as, interestingly, also in the living, show
markedly less favorably. The Nunivak skulls, as with the living, are
somewhat above the average, while in the small Pilot Station
(Yukon) group, just as in the near-by contingent of Marshall among
the living, the males have the largest heads in this western territory.
The lower Yukon Eskimo were also shown, it may be recalled, to be
of a higher stature than the majority of the coast people. It is a
group that deserves further attention.</p>

<p>The module of the female skull does not evidently stand always
in harmony with that of the male. The most striking example of
this is shown, as already mentioned, by the St. Lawrence Island
females, both skulls and the living. The females of this isolated
island are also unduly short, but their small head is not entirely
due to the defective stature. There must exist on this island, it would
seem, some conditions that are disadvantageous to the female. In
the small groups, such as that from the Little Diomede, the disharmonies
are doubtless partly due to small numbers of specimens, but
there may also be other factors, such as the bringing in of women

<p>Taking the mean of all the groups equalizes conditions, and it is
seen that the module in both sexes is almost identical with that of
the more northern groups, to Point Barrow. But the north Arctic
and northeastern groups give a cranial module that in both sexes is
somewhat higher, though their stature, according to the available
data (Deniker, Boas, Duckworth, Steensby, Thalbitzer), is not
superior.</p>

<p>A very remarkable showing is that of the percentage relation of the
female to male skull size in the three large groupings. In the first two
it is identical, in the third it differs less than could confidently be expected
among the closest relatives. Another remarkable fact is that
this important relation is found to be much like that in the Eskimo
in various groups of Indians; thus it was <em>96</em> in the Indians o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>f
Arkansas and Louisiana,[3] <em>95.5</em> in the Munsee of New Jersey,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and <em>96.4</em>
in the Indian skulls of California.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> But it is only <em>93.6</em> in the Sioux
(52 male, 40 female skulls) and differs more or less also in other
tribes and peoples. A comprehensive study of this relation, with
due respect to age, will some day well repay the effort.</p>

<h4>MODULE AND CAPACITY</h4>

<p>A comparison of considerable interest is also that of the cranial
module or mean diameter, to the capacity of the same skulls. This
comparison reveals an important sex factor.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Relatively to the
module, the capacity is very appreciably smaller in the female than it
is in the male. This is a universal condition to which, so far as known,
there are occasional individual but no group exceptions. It appears
very clearly in the Eskimo. In 283 western male Eskimo skulls in
which we have so far measured the capacity,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the module averages
15.38 centimeters, the capacity 1,490 cubic centimeters; while
in 382 female skulls thus far gauged the former averages 14.82
centimeters, the latter 1,337 cubic centimeters. The percentage
relation of the capacity to the module, the numbers taken
as a whole, is <em>96.8</em> in the males but only <em>90.2</em> in the females. This
means that relatively to the external size of the skull the female
Eskimo brain is 6.66 per cent smaller. Similar sex disproportion
exists in other American groups as well as elsewhere. Some day
when suitable data accumulate it will be of much interest to study
this condition on a wider scale.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL REMARKS ON CRANIAL MODULE</h4>

<p>Before we leave this subject, it may be well to point out two noteworthy
facts apparent from the data on the northwestern and northeastern
groups. The first is that the figures on both sexes from
Barrow and Point Barrow are very nearly the same, suggesting
strongly the identity of the people of the two settlements; and the
Point Hope group is in close relation. The second fact is the curious
identity of the old Igloo group, 8 miles southwest of Barrow, with
the Greenlanders. The import of this will be seen later.</p>


<h4>SKULL SHAPE</h4>

<p>Utilizing the materials of the Otis and Barnard Davis Catalogues
and with measurements taken for him on additional specimens in
several of our museums, Boas, in 1895 (Verh. Berl. anthrop. Ges.,
398), as already mentioned, reported the cranial index of 37 "western
Eskimo" skulls of both sexes (without giving localities or details)
as <em>77</em>. He also reports in the same place (p. 391) the cephalic
index of 61 probably male living "Alaska Eskimo," again without
locality, as <em>79.2</em>. These rather high indices and the relatively elevated
stature (61 subjects, 165.8 centimeters) lead him to believe (p. 376)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>that both are probably due to an admixture with the Alaskan Indian,
though the report contains no measurements of the latter.</p>

<p>The data that it is now possible to present may perhaps throw a
new light on the matter. As was already seen in part from the data
on the living, the head resp. the skull tends to relative shortness
and broadness throughout the southwestern, midwestern, and Bering
Sea region (excepting parts of the Seward Peninsula). Important
groups in this region, particularly those on some of the islands, had
little or no contact with the Indian. The cranial index in most of
the groups of the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo equals or
even exceeds that of the Indian. And Eskimo groups with a relatively
elevated cranial index are met with even in the far north, as
at Point Hope, Hudson Bay, and Smith Sound.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Finally, the
shorter and broader head connects with that of the Asiatic Eskimo
and that of the Chukchee, as well as other northeastern Asiatics.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The records now available show the highest cranial indices to
occur on the coast between Bristol Bay and the Yukon and on lower
Yukon itself, while the lowest indices of the midwest area, though
still mesocranic, occur in the aggregate of Nunivak Island and the
mouths of the Yukon. Another geographical as well as somatological
aggregate is that of the people of the St. Lawrence and Diomede
Islands and of Indian Point, Siberia, the cranial index in these three
localities being identical.</p>

<p>The Seward Peninsula shows sudden differences. There are a
few localities along its southern coast where the cranial type belongs
apparently to the Bering Sea and southern area. One site at Port
Clarence was one of these. But already at Golovnin Bay, which
is not far from Norton Sound and St. Michael Island, and according
to the evidence of the most recent collections (Collins 1928), also
at Sledge Island, there is a sudden appearance of marked dolichocrany,
which is repeated at Wales, on the western extremity of the
peninsula, approached at Shishmaref, the main Eskimo settlement
on its northern shore, and, judging from some fragmentary material
seen at the eastern end of the Salt Lake, also in the interior. The
cause of this distinctive feature in the Seward Peninsula is for the
present elusive. The little known territory urgently needs a thorough
exploration.</p>

<p>The distribution of the cranial index farther north along the
western coast shows several points of interest. The first is the
exceptional position of Point Hope, one of the oldest and most populous
settlements in these regions, which by its cranial index seems
to connect with the Bering Sea groups. The second is the closeness,
once more, of Barrow and Point Barrow. The third and greatest
is the presence, in a small cluster of old igloos 8 miles down the coast
from Barrow, of a group of people that finds no counterpart in its
cranial index and, as will be seen later, also in some other characteristics,
in the entire western region; in fact, in the whole Eskimo
territory outside of Greenland. As noted before, the size of the head
in this group is also closest to that of Greenland. These peculiar
facts indicate a problem that will call for separate consideration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>The northern and northeastern groups, with the exception of the
mesocranic Hudson Bay and Smith Sound contingents, and the very
dolichocranic Greenlanders, show dolichocrany much the same as
that of Barrow and Point Barrow.</p>

<h4>HEIGHT OF THE SKULL</h4>

<p>This is a measurement of much value, both alone and as a supplement
to the cranial index, for skulls with the same index may be
high or low and thus really of a radically distinct type.</p>

<p>The height of the vault is best studied in its relation to the other
cranial dimensions, particularly to the mean of the length and
breadth, with both of which it correlates. But in the Eskimo it is
also of interest to compare the height with the breadth of the skull
alone. The former relation is known as the mean height index
and the latter as the height-breadth index. Both mean the percentage
value of the basion-bregma height as compared to the other
dimensions.</p>

<p>The mean height index <span class="overunder">H<br /><span class="bt">(Mean of L+B)</span></span>        advocated independently

by the writer since 1916 (Bull. 62, Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 116),
is proving of much value in differentiation of types and has already
become a permanent feature in all writers' work on the skull.
There is a corresponding index also on the living.</p>

<p>In the American Indian the averages of the index range from
approximately 76 to 90. (See Catalogue of Crania, U. S. Nat. Mus.,
Nos. I and II.) Where the series of specimens are sufficiently large
the index does not differ materially in the two sexes. Indices below
80 may be regarded as low, those between 80 and 84 as medium,
and those above 84 as high.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The southwestern and midwestern Eskimo skulls show mean
height indices that may be characterized as moderate to slightly above
medium. In general the broader and shorter skulls show lower
indices, approaching thus in all the characters of the vault the
Mongolian skulls of Asia. (Compare Catalogue Crania, U. S. Nat.
Mus., No. I.) The Indian Point, St. Lawrence Island, and Little
Diomede Island skulls are again, as with the cranial index, very close
together, strengthening the evidence that the three constitute the
same group of people. (Pls. 59, 60.)</p>

<p>The northwestern Eskimo and most of those of the northeast
have relatively high vault. Barrow and Point Barrow are once
more almost the same. The Point Hope group shows a high vault,
though also rather broad. The somewhat broad Hudson Bay crania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
are but moderately high, like those of the southwestern Eskimo. The
northern Arctic skulls give smaller height than would be expected
with their type; the Southampton Island specimens give higher.
The old Igloo group from near Barrow stands again close to Greenland;
its skull is even a trace narrower and higher, standing in both
respects at the limits of the Eskimo. The whole, as with the cranial
index, shows evidently a rich field of evolutionary conditions.</p>

<h4>THE FACE</h4>

<p>The facial dimensions of the Eskimo skull offer a number of points
of unusual interest. The face is absolutely and especially relatively
to stature very large in all measurements. It is particularly high
between the upper alveolar point and nasion.</p>

<p>The large size of the Eskimo face will best be appreciated from
a few figures.</p>

<p>So far as known there are no larger faces among the Indians than
those of the Sioux, yet they remain very perceptibly, in all three
measurements, behind the Eskimo. No face as large as that of the
Eskimo is known, in fact, from anywhere else in the world. In
whites the mean diameter of the largest faces (see data in Martin's
Lehrbuch Anthrop., 789-791) does not exceed 10.36 centimeters.
The above showing assumes especial weight when it is recalled that
both the Siouan and the Algonquian tribes are among the tallest there
are on the American Continent. The cause of the large size of the
Eskimo face can only be the excessive use of the jaws; no other
reason even suggests itself. But the character may already be more
or less hereditary. It furnishes another attractive subject for further
investigation.</p>

<p>With its large dimensions the face of the Eskimo skull presents
generally also large orbits, large molars, submedium prominence and
breadth of the nasal bridge, shallow suborbital (canine) fossae, large
dental arch above medium teeth, and a large and stout lower jaw
with broad not seldom more or less everted angles, giving the whole
a characteristic appearance. With partial exception of the orbits
and the nose, which are subject also to other factors, all these features
of the Eskimo face are explainable as strengthenings resulting from
the increased function of mastication.</p>

<p>The main dimensions of the cranial face in the three large groupings
of the Eskimo are given in the next table.</p>

<p>These data show a number of interesting conditions. The height
of the upper face (alveolar point-nasion) is greatest in the southwestern
and midwestern groups, is slightly lower in the northwesterners,
and still further slightly lower in the north Arctic and the
northeast. On the other hand the facial breadth is slightly higher
in the north and east, and that although the vault has become
mostly decidedly narrower.</p>

<p>These facts are shown best by the upper facial index, which in the
males descends quite perceptibly in the west from the south to the
north and in the Arctic from the west to the east. In the females
there is a parallel gradual diminution in the upper facial height
from the south to the north and then east, but the facial breadth
diminishes very slightly also instead of increasing, as a result of
which the upper facial index shows only minor differences; yet these
differences are in the same direction as those in the males.</p>

<p>These matters are involved with a number of factors&mdash;the stature,
the breadth of the vault, and the development and direct influence
of the temporal muscles, besides hereditary conditions. Their proper
study will necessitate even more&mdash;in fact, much more&mdash;material than
is now at our disposal.</p>

<p>The following table gives the distribution of the upper cranial
facial index in the various groups. Of the two indices that of the
whole face, including the lower jaw, is the less valuable; first, because
the jaw is often absent; second, because it is influenced by the height
of the lower jaw, which does not correlate perfectly with the upper;
and third, on account of the wear of the teeth, which in such people
as the Eskimo is very common and diminishes more or less the total
height of the face. Its averages in the three main groupings have
already been given. Its figures are not very exceptional.</p>

<p>The upper facial index of the Eskimo skull is high, though there is
considerable group variation. The reason is the height of the upper
face, for which the accompanying considerable expansion of the zygomatic
arches does not fully compensate. In the white groups this
index ranges from approximately <em>50</em> to <em>54</em>; it averages <em>52.9</em> in 15
Algonquian and <em>53.1</em> in 12 Siouan tribes. The means in the large
Eskimo groupings are from a little below <em>54</em> to a little over <em>55</em>. Its
regional differences have already been mentioned. Sex differences
in the index are very small. There are a number of points of significant
agreement, the foremost of which is once more that in the
case of Barrow and Point Barrow, and especially that of the Old
Igloos near Barrow and Greenland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE NOSE</h4>

<p>Equally as engaging as the whole face of the Eskimo skull is the
cranial nose. Our data throw much light on this feature also.</p>

<p>Where the dimensions of the whole face are altered by some cause
the nose can not remain unaffected. This is especially true of its
height, which correlates directly and closely with that of the face
proper; the correlation of the breadth of the nose with that of the
face is weaker and more irregular, but not absent where not counteracted
by other factors. Accordingly with the high Eskimo upper
face there is found also a high nose, both being the highest known
to anthropometry. But the nasal breadth, instead of responding to
the considerable facial breadth, has become smaller, until in some of
the Eskimo groups it is the smallest of all known human groups.
There is plainly another potent factor in action here. This factor
could conceivably be connected simply with the above-average growth
of the facial bones; but if this were so then individuals with smaller
development of these bones ought to have broader noses, and vice
versa. This point can readily be tested. Taking the largest and best
cranial series, that of St. Lawrence Island, and selecting the skulls
with the smallest and the largest faces, the facts come out as follows:</p>

<p>The above data show that while the narrow nose in the Eskimo is
to some extent affected by the large development in these people of
the facial bones, yet there must be also other factors.</p>

<p>But if not wholly connected with the development of the facial
bones, then some of the causes of the narrow nose in the Eskimo must
either be inherited from far back or must be due to influences outside
the face itself.</p>

<p>Pushing the character far back would be no explanation of its
original cause, but it may be shown that such a procedure would not
be justified. In the following important table are given the now
available data on the breadth of the nasal aperture of the Eskimo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
group by group and area by area, and these data show that narrow
nose is by no means universal in this family. The nasal aperture
is broader in the southwest and midwest than in the northwest, and
broader in the latter region than in the Arctic north, and the northeast.
In general it is seen that the farther northward and northeastward
the narrower the nose, until it reaches beyond that of all
other human groups; while in the west and southwest it gradually
approaches until it reaches the nasal breadth of the Indian. And
that this latter condition is not due to Indian admixture is shown
by the fact that among the broadest noses are those of the Eskimo
in Siberia and those on the St. Lawrence Island, where there was
no known contact with the Indian, while the narrower noses are
along the midwestern coast, where Indian admixture might have
been possible.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible, therefore, to assume that a narrow nose is an
<em>ancient</em> inheritance of the Eskimo. From the facts now at hand it
seems much more probable that the Eskimo nose or respiratory nasal
aperture was not originally very narrow, but that it gradually
acquired this character as the people extended farther north and
northeastward; and there appears to be but one potent factor that
could influence this development and that increases from south to
north, namely, cold. A narrowing of the aperture can readily be
understood as a protective development for the throat and the organs
of respiration.</p>

<p>It is not easy to see how the bony structures respond to the effects of
cold or heat, but that they do, particularly where these are aggravated
by moisture, has long been appreciated, and shown fairly conclusively
through studies on the nasal index by Thomson and later
by Thomson and Buxton.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> An even more satisfactory study would
have been that of the nasal breadth alone. Perhaps the normal
variation with the elimination of the less fit are the main agencies.</p>

<p>The next two tables show other interesting conditions. The first
of these, seen best from the more general data, are the relations of
the nasal dimensions and index in the two sexes. The females in
all the three large groupings have a higher nasal index than the
males. This is a general condition among the Indians as well as in
other races. It is usually due to a relative shortness of the female
nose. This condition is very plain in the Eskimo. The female nose
is actually narrower than the male, due to correlation with shorter
stature and lesser facial breadth, yet the index is higher. The reason
can most simply be shown by comparing the general mean nasal
breadth and height in the two sexes. The breadth in the female is
approximately 96.2 per cent of that in the male; the height is only
92.7 per cent.</p>

<p>Detailed group data on the nasal index show that this ranges from
<em>47.7</em> on the Yukon to <em>41.8</em> in the northernmost contingent of the
Eskimo at Smith Sound. The Kotzebue group that shows even a
higher index than on the Yukon is too small to have much weight.
Barrow and Point Barrow are once more nearly the same, as are the
Old Igloos and Greenland; and there are some other interesting
relations.</p>

<h4>THE ORBITS</h4>

<p>In many American groups the orbits are notoriously variable, yet
their mean dimensions and index are of value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The Eskimo orbits have long been known for their ample proportions.
Their mean height and breadth are larger than those of any
other known people and the excess is especially apparent when proportioned
to stature. Taking the family as a whole, the mean height
of the two orbits in males averages approximately 3.64 centimeters,
the mean breadth 4.03 centimeters; while the males of 23 Algonquian
tribes give for the same items 3.42 and 3.93, and those of 12 Siouan
tribes 3.58 and 3.96 centimeters.</p>

<p>The general averages for the female Eskimo approach for orbital
height 3.52 centimeters, for breadth 3.89 centimeters, dimensions
which also surpass those in the females of any other known human
group.</p>

<p>These large dimensions of the Eskimo orbit are, however, on closer
examination into the matter, found not to be racial characters except
in a secondary way. They are the direct consequence of the high and
broad face. The correlation of the orbital height and breadth with
the height and breadth of the face are shown by the following
figures. These figures indicate also some additional details of
interest.</p>

<p>The general orbital index of the Eskimo is close to <em>90</em> in the
males, <em>90.5</em> in the females. Such orbits are classed as also <em>relatively</em>
high or <em>megaseme</em>, a character in which they resemble many of the
American Indians. Thus the male crania of the Siouan tribes give
the practically identical general index of <em>90.5</em>.</p>

<p>The slightly higher index in the females is the rule to which there
are but few exceptions, and those in individual groups where the
numbers of specimens may not be sufficient. The same tendency is
observable in the Indians, and appears in fact to be panhuman. It
is due to slightly lesser relative height as compared to the breadth
of the orbit in the males, which condition is due in all probability
to the greater development in the males of the frontal sinuses and
supraorbital arches.</p>

<p>Individual variation in the orbital index of the Eskimo is extensive,
reaching from slightly below <em>80</em> to well over <em>100</em>. It extends
more or less over the whole Eskimo area, without conveying
definite indication anywhere of either a mixture or of a special evolutionary
tendency. Yet it occasions group differences that eventually
might prove evolutionary, though they may merely represent the
next or higher order of variability, namely, that of groups within
a family.</p>

shown in the next table. They elude a satisfactory explanation, unless
recourse is had to the above suggested theory of normal group
variability within a family. They have about the same range in
the three large areas, which would seem to support this theory.</p>

<h4>THE UPPER ALVEOLAR ARCH</h4>

<p>The dental arches correlate with function (use), with stature, with
the dimensions of the face, and with those of the teeth. The western
as well as other Eskimo show arches that are about equal in absolute
dimensions to those of our taller Indians, such as the Munsee, Arkansas,
and Louisiana;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> but relatively to stature the Eskimo arch is
decidedly larger.</p>

<p>The upper dental arch index <span class="overunder"><span class="bb">L×100</span><br />B</span>, now being used in preference
to the unwieldy "uranic index" <span class="overunder"><span class="bb">B×100</span><br />L</span> of Turner, is
rather high, showing that the arch is relatively, as well as absolutely,
broad. The same index in the Munsee averaged in the males
<em>82.8</em>, in the females <em>82.7</em>; in the Arkansas and Louisiana mound skulls
<em>84.4</em> in the males and <em>85.1</em> in the females. Data are needed here for
more extensive comparisons.</p>

<p>Sex differences in the index are small, nevertheless the females
tend to show a slightly higher index, due to relatively slightly
smaller breadth of the arch.</p>

<p>The size of the arch and its index differ but little over the three
main areas of the Eskimo territory, yet there are slight differences.
They appear plainly in the following table. Notwithstanding the
fact that on the whole the southwestern and midwestern groups are
somewhat taller than those of the far north and northeast, the largest
palate, in the males at least, is found in the latter area.</p>

<p>In the southwest and midwest the upper alveolar arch is relatively
(as well as absolutely, barring one group) somewhat broad and
short. This may be in correlation with the broader head in this
area, just as the absolutely slightly longer palates over the rest of the
Eskimo territory and particularly (in males) in the northeast may
correlate with the longer heads in those regions. This point may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>

<p>The above figures show several conditions. The first is that the
arch is quite distinctly larger in the narrow than in the broad skulls
in both sexes. The second fact is that the skull (vault) itself is
slightly larger in the narrow-headed. The third is that the length of
the arch is somewhat greater in the narrow and long skulls than it is
in the broad and shorter, relatively to the skull size. The fourth is
that there appears a close correlation, more particularly in the
females, between the length of the arch and that of the skull.</p>

<h4>THE BASION-NASION DIAMETER</h4>

<p>The anterior basal length (basion-nasion) is a measurement of
importance, though its full meaning in anthropology is not yet
entirely clear. From data quoted by Martin (Lehrb., 715-716) it
appears to average in whites up to 10.3 centimeters in males and up
to 10.1 centimeters in females, and is known to correlate closely with
the length of the vault. Secondarily it also correlates with stature.</p>

<p>Data on American Indians are not yet generally available, though
in preparation. The Munsee skulls gave the writer for the diameter
the means of 10.27 for the males and 10.02 for the females; the
mound skulls from Arkansas and Louisiana gave 10.45 for the males
and 9.77 for the females.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>An abstract of the data on the Eskimo skulls is given in the next
table. The values for the measurement are rather high, especially
for such short people. The percentage relation of the measurement
to the length of the skull appears also to be high. Manouvrier (1882,
quoted in Martin, Lehrb., 716) found this relation in French skulls
to be <em>53.6</em> in the males and <em>54.7</em> in the females.</p>

<p>The female measurement to that of the male, in the Eskimo, is
as <em>94.9</em> to 100. As a similar relation of the cranial modules in the
two sexes is close to <em>95.7</em>, the anterior basal length would seem to be at
a little disadvantage in the female Eskimo skull.</p>

<p>The same condition is seen also when the basion-nasion diameter
is compared with the length of the skull. In the males, notwithstanding
the fact that the length of the vault is increased through the
development of the frontal sinuses and not infrequently also through
that of the occipital ridges, the percentage relation of the basion-nasion
to the maximum total length of the vault is approximately
<em>56.3</em>, in the females but <em>55.8</em>. It seems therefore safe to say that in
the Eskimo, in general, that part of the brain anterior to the foramen
magnum is relatively somewhat better developed in the males
than in the females.</p>

<p>But to this there are some exceptions. Thus it may be seen in the
general table which follows that in the northwestern groups conditions
in this respect are equalized; and in the succeeding detailed
table it will be noted that while the males exceed the females in this
particular in 14 of the groups, in 5 groups conditions are equal (or
within one decimal), and in 5 the female percentage exceeds slightly
that in the males. In the numerically best represented groups conditions
are nearly equal, with the males nevertheless slightly favored.</p>

<p>An interesting point is that in the north and northeast, where the
skulls are longest, there is evidently a slightly greater relative development
of the occipital portion of the vault, or slightly lesser
development of the frontal portion.</p>

<p>Some additional points of interest appear when the basion-nasion:
skull-length index, taken collectively for the two sexes, is compared
in the different groups. All these comparisons suffer, naturally,
from unevenness and often insufficiency of the numbers of specimens,
yet some of the results are very harmonious with those brought out
repeatedly by other data. Thus the St. Lawrence material stands
once more close to the medium of the southwestern and midwestern
groups; Barrow and Point Barrow are almost identical; and so are
the Old Igloos from near Barrow and Greenland. The St. Michael
islanders show very favorably in the midwest, the Shishmarefs in
the northwest and the Southampton islanders in the northeast.</p>

<p>The next table gives the percentage relations of the basion-nasion
diameter to the mean diameter of the skull. The correlation of the
two is even closer than in the case of the skull length, and the
grouping, while in the main alike, seems in general even more in
harmony with that in previous comparisons. The St. Lawrence
Island females are very exceptional, as was also apparent in other
connections. The unusual smallness of their skull (compare section
on Cranial module) is evidently due to a poor development of its
posterior half.</p>

<h4>PROGNATHISM</h4>

<p>Since better understood, the subject of facial prognathism has lost
much of its allure in anthropology; yet the matter is not wholly without
interest.</p>

<p>Facial protrusion is as a rule secondary to and largely caused by
alveolar protrusion, which in turn is caused by the size and shape of
the dental arch; and the dental arch is generally proportional to the
size of the teeth. The form of the arch is, however, quite influential.
With the teeth identical in size a narrow arch will be more, a broad
arch less protruding, and a narrow arch with small teeth may protrude
more than a broad one with larger teeth. Another influence
is that of the height of the upper face, the same arch protruding more
in a low face than in a high one. And still another factor is the incline
of the front teeth, though this affects merely the appearance of
prognathism and not its measurements.</p>

<p>There are different ways of measuring facial prognathism, and
with sufficient care all may be effective; I prefer, for practical
reasons, linear measurements from the basion, which, together with
the facial and subnasal heights, give triangles that can readily be
reconstructed on paper and allow a direct measurement of both the
facial and the alveolar angle. The three needed diameters from
basion are taken, the first to the "prealveolar point," or the <em>most
anterior</em> point on the upper dental arch above the incisors; the second
to the "subnasal point," or the point on the left (for convenience)
of the nasal aperture, where the outer part of its border
passes into that which belongs to the subnasal portion of the maxilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
(the point where the subnasal slant begins); and the third to nasion.
The facial height is that from the alveolar point (<em>lowest</em> point of
the upper alveolar border in the median line) to nasion; while for
the subnasal height, which can not be measured directly, I utilize
the difference between the facial and nasal heights, which is very
close to the needed dimension.</p>

<p>The important basion-nasion diameter has already been considered.
That to the subnasal point needs no comment. That to the prealveolar
point shows in the western and other Eskimo as follows:</p>

the people and to absence of heterogeneous admixtures. As the
skull length increases so does the basi-alveolar line, but the relative
proportions of the two remain very nearly the same.</p>

<p>The relative value of the basi-alveolar length in the males, compared
to the length of the skull, is in general about 0.5 per cent
higher than it is in the females. This is just about the excess of the
relative proportion of the length of the male dental arch when compared
to the same skull dimension. The general mean skull length
in the Eskimo male approximates 18.705, in female 17.899 centimeters;
the mean length of the arch is, in the male, close to 5.625,
in the female 5.365 centimeters; and the percentage relation of the
latter to the former is <em>30.6</em> in the males, <em>30</em> in the females. The
relatively slightly greater basi-alveolar length in the males is evidently,
therefore, at least partly due to the relatively longer male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
dental arch, which in turn is doubtless due to the somewhat larger
teeth in the males.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the just discussed slight sex difference in the
Eskimo, the facial angle, i. e., the angle between the basi-alveolar line
and the line nasion-alveolar point, is equal in the two sexes. This
equalization is due largely, if not wholly, to the effect in the males
of the relatively longer basio-nasion diameter (v. a.), while the
alveolar angle, or that between the basi-alveolar and the subnasal
lines, is in general by about 1 per cent lower in the females (males,
56°; females, 55°), indicating a slightly greater slant of the subnasal
region in the female, which can only be due to a relatively slightly
shorter in this sex of the basion-subnasal point diameter. As a matter
of fact, the percentage relation of this diameter to the length of the
skull amounts in the males to <em>56.3</em>, in the females to but <em>55.6</em>.</p>

<p>Compared to that in the Indians, the facial angle in the Eskimo
skulls shows close affinities. Its value (69°) is very nearly the same
as in the mound skulls from Arkansas and Louisiana (males 70.7°,
females 69°). In other Indians it ranges from close to 68° to 71.5°.
In the Munsee it reached 73.5°. In whites, according to Rivet's
data,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> it ranges from about 72° to 75°; in a group of negroes it was
68.5°. In American and other negro crania measured by me<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> it
ranged from 67° to 70.5°, in Melanesians from 66° to 68°, in Australians
from 67° to 69°.</p>

<p>The <em>alveolar angle</em> is more variable. It shows considerable individual,
sex, and group differences. It averages slightly to moderately
higher, which means a more open angle or less slant in the males
than in the females. In the Eskimo as a whole it was seen to be
approximately 56° in the males, 55° in the females; in the Munsee
Indians (Bull. 62, Bur. Amer. Ethn.) it was males 59°, females
57°; in the Arkansas and Louisiana skulls (J. Ac. Sci., Phila., 1909,
XIV) it averaged males 55°, females 52°. In my catalogue material
it shows a group variation of 46.5° to 55.5° in the negro, 47.5°
to 52.5° in the Australians, 46.5° to 50.5° in the Melanesians. In the
whites it generally exceeds 60°.</p>

<p>Differences in facial and alveolar protrusion among the Eskimo
according to area are small, yet they are not wholly absent. The
figures below show that in the southwesterners and midwesterners,
where the skull is more rounded, the prognathism is smallest; and
that toward the north and northeast, where the skull is narrower
and the palate (dental arch) tends to become longer, prognathism
increases. The "Old Igloo" group shows once more such affinity with
the Greenlanders that it is placed with the third subdivision.</p>

<p>Individual group differences in the facial and alveolar angle are
moderate, yet evidently not negligible. (See next table.) The most
prognathic, especially in the subnasal region, are the skulls from
Nelson Island. A marked alveolar slant is also present in the Pilot
Station Yukon group, and in Greenland. The least prognathic are
the St. Michael Islanders, the Point Hope people, and those from
Southampton Island. St. Lawrence stands once more near the
middle of the southwesterners and midwesterners, and there are to be
seen the principal old relations.</p>

<p>The main points shown by the above conditions are the group
variability, particularly in the southwest and midwest; the tendency,
on the whole, toward a slightly greater prognathy, both facial and
alveolar, in this same area; and the evidence that the alveolar slant
has some individuality.</p>

<h2>SKULLS OF ESKIMO CHILDREN</h2>


<p>A special effort in our work has been made to secure well-preserved
skulls of children. As elsewhere, so among the Eskimo, more
children die than adults, but conditions are not favorable for the
preservation of their skeletal remains. Most of the bones are done
away with or damaged by animals (foxes, dogs, mice, etc.), while
others decay, so that generally nothing remains of the youngest
subjects and but a few bones and a rare skull of the older children.
The total number of such skulls in our collection now reaches 25.
They are all of children of more than 2 but mostly less than 6 years
old, and are all normal specimens. The principal measurements of
their vault&mdash;a study of the face is a subject apart and needing more
material&mdash;are given in the following tables.</p>

<p>The main interest centers in the comparison of the relative proportions
of these skulls with those of the adults from the same localities.
These comparisons, given in the smaller table, are of considerable
interest.</p>

<p>The cranial index is considerably higher in the children. On
analysis this is found to be due almost wholly to a greater relative
breadth of the child's skull. During later growth the Eskimo
cranium advances materially more in length than in breadth. A
further expansion in breadth is evidently hindered by some factor
outside of the bones themselves, for nothing appears in these that
could constitute such a hindrance. And the only evident outside factor
capable of producing such an effect are the strong pads of the
temporal muscles.</p>

<p>The mean height index <span class="overunder">H×100<br /><span class="bt">mean of L+B</span></span> remains much the same
in the children and adults, indicating that the relative increase during
growth in skull length compensates for the lagging increase in
breadth, while the proportion of the height to the mean of the length
and breadth remains fairly stable.</p>

<p>The much greater growth in length than in breadth of the Eskimo
skull from childhood onward is shown even better in the second part
of the table by a direct comparison of the mean dimensions. The
length of the adult skull is by over 9 per cent, the breadth by less
than 4 per cent, greater than that in childhood in the same groups.</p>

<p>The adult Eskimo skull has also grown very perceptibly more in
height than in breadth, though somewhat less so than in length. The
result is a notably higher height-breadth index in the adult. Compared
to that in childhood the adult Eskimo skull is therefore relatively
markedly longer, higher, and narrower.</p>

<p>These facts are probably of more significance than might seem at
first glance; for it is precisely by the same characters, carried still
further, that some of the Eskimo differ from others. Let us compare
two of our largest and best groups, those of St. Lawrence Island
and Greenland:</p>

<p>The Greenland skull is longer, narrower, and somewhat higher.
The differences are less than those between a child and an adult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
western Eskimo, but of the same nature. This apparently speaks
strongly for the development of the Greenland type of Eskimo
cranium from the western. On the other hand, the type of skull
shown by the Eskimo child approaches much more closely than that
of the Eskimo adult to the type of the skull of the Mongol.</p>

<p>The above are mere observations, not theories, and they carry
a strong indication that mostly we are still floundering only on the
borders of true anthropology, embracing all phases of life and development,
which, if mastered, would give us with beautiful definition
many now vainly sought or barely glimpsed solutions.</p>

<p>A highly interesting feature is the relatively great development
in the Eskimo, between childhood and the adult stage, of the anterior
half of the skull or basion-nasion dimension. This augments, it is
seen, by even 3.4 per cent more than the length. This growth must
involve some additional factor to those inherent in the bones themselves
and in the attached musculature, and this can only be, it seems,
the development of the anterior half of the brain. Evidently this
portion of the brain between childhood and adult life grows in the
Eskimo more rapidly than that behind the vertical plane corresponding
to the basion. It is a very suggestive condition calling for further
study, and thus far almost entirely wanting in comparative data
on other human as well as subhuman groups.</p>

<h2>THE LOWER JAW</h2>


<p>The lower jaw of the Eskimo deserves a thorough separate study.
For this purpose, however, more jaws in good condition are needed
from various localities, and particularly more jaws accompanying
their skulls. As it is, a large majority of the crania are without the
lower jaw, or the alveolar processes of the latter have become so
affected in life through age and loss of teeth that their value is diminished
or lost. Still another serious difficulty is that the measuring of
the lower jaw is difficult and has not as yet been regulated by general
agreement, so that there is much individualism of procedures with
limited possibilities of comparison.</p>

<p>One of the principal measurements taken on the available Eskimo
mandibles was the symphyseal height. This is taken by the sliding
calipers and is the height from the lower alveolar point (highest
point of the normal alveolar septum between the middle lower incisors)
to the lowest point on the inferior border of the chin in the
median line.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The results are given in the following tables.</p>

<p>The table shows the Eskimo jaw to be absolutely the highest at
the symphysis of all those available for comparison, with the female
nearly the highest.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Relatively to stature it exceeds decidedly all
the groups, the Indians that come nearest matching it in the absolute
measurement being all much taller than the Eskimo. And the
female Eskimo jaw is relatively high compared with that of the
male, being exceeded in this respect only in three of the Indian
groups, in two of which, however, the showing is due wholly and
in one partly to a lesser height of the male jaw. The relative excess
of the female jaw in this respect seems particularly marked in the
northern and northeastern groups, though it must remain subject
to corroboration by further material.</p>

<p>The white, Negro, and Australian data have an interest of their
own.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strength of the Jaw</span></h3>

<p>The Eskimo jaw is generally stout. Barring rare exceptions there
is nothing slender about it. The body, moreover, is frequently
strengthened by more or less marked overgrowths of bone lingually
below the alveoli and above the mylohyoid ridge. These neoformations
will be discussed later.</p>

<p>The strength of the mandible may be measured directly in various
locations on the body. Due to the peculiar build of the body, however,
and especially to its variations, these measurements are by no
means simple and wholly satisfactory. It is hardly necessary in this
connection to review the various attempted methods, none of which
has become standardized. As a result of experience I prefer since
many years to measure the thickness of the body of the jaw at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
second molars, and that in such a way that either the molars, if the
measurement is taken from above, or the lower border of the jaw if
it is taken from below, lies midway between the two branches of
the sliding calipers with which the measurement is taken. The two
methods (from above or below) give results that are nearly alike.
In some cases the one and in others the other is the easier, but
wherever the teeth are lost the measurement from below is perhaps
preferable. The records obtained on the lower jaws of the western
Eskimo and other racial groups are given in the next table.</p>

<p>The figures show that the Eskimo jaw is very stout. It is exceeded
in thickness only by the jaws of Florida, which in general
are the thickest in America, and in males is about equaled, in females
very slightly exceeded by those of the prehistoric Indians of Louisiana,
who belong to the same Gulf type with the Indians of Florida.
The old Arkansas Indians, though closely related to those of
Louisiana, show a very perceptibly more slender jaw, particularly
in the males; while in an old Kentucky tribe (Green River, C. B.
Moore, collector) the jaws are still less strong. The lower jaws of
the American whites (dissecting-room material) are slightly less
stout than even those of the Indians of Kentucky in the males, and
much less so in the females. The interesting sex differences are
shown well in the last column of the above table.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Breadth of the Rami</span></h3>

<p>Still another character that reflects the strength of the lower jaw
is the breadth of the rami. The most practicable measurement of
this is the breadth minimum at the constriction of the ascending
branches. A great breadth of the rami is very striking, as is well
known, in the Heidelberg jaw, and the Eskimo have long been known
for a marked tendency in the same direction. The measurements of
the lower jaws of the western Eskimo show as follows:</p>

<p>The Eskimo lower jaw, which, as seen before, is characterized by
a high and stout body and the broadest rami, shows further that
these rami are remarkably low, and that the bigonial spread is
extraordinarily broad. The length of the body, on the other hand,
is not very exceptional, being perceptibly exceeded in some of the
Indians.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Angle</span></h3>

<p>The angle between the body and the ramus of the lower jaw is
known to differ with the age and sex as well as individually. Not
seldom it differs also, and that sometimes quite appreciably, on the
two sides. Racial differences are as yet uncertain.</p>

<p>The angle, especially in some specimens, is not easy to measure,
and the position of the jaw may make a difference of several degrees.
Numerous trials have shown that the proper way is to measure the
angle on the two sides separately, and to so place the jaw in each
case that there is no interference with the measurement by either
the posterior or the anterior enlarged end of the condyle.</p>

<p>Leaving out jaws in which extensive loss of teeth has in all
probability resulted in changes in the angle, the western Eskimo
material gives the following data:</p>

<p>In the male Munsee Indians the angle was 118°; in those of
Arkansas and Louisiana, 118.5°; in those of Peru (Martin, Lehrb.,
884), 119°. In the whites, males, the average angle approximates
122°; in the Negro, 121° (Topinard, Martin).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>The angle in the female in the Eskimo is to that of the male as
104 to 100; in the Arkansas and Louisiana series it was 103. In
the whites the proportion seems to be a little higher.</p>

<p>There are evidently, if we exclude the whites in whom the shortness
of the jaw conduces probably to a wider angle, no marked racial
differences, but the subject needs a more thorough study on large
series of sexually well-identified specimens, carefully selected as
to age.</p>

<p>The average angle on the right differs in the Eskimo but very
slightly from that on the left, though individually there are frequent
unequalities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Résumé</span></h3>

<p>The Eskimo lower jaw differs substantially in many respects from
that in other races, particularly from that of the whites. It is characterized
by a high and stout body; by broad but low rami; and by
excessive breadth at the angles. The body-ramus angle is moderate.
To which may be added that the chin is generally of but moderate
prominence, and that the bone at the angles in males is occasionally
markedly everted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mandibular Hyperostoses</span></h3>

<p>These hypertrophies or hyperostoses are rarely met with also in the
jaws of the Indian and other people. They are symmetric and
characteristic, though often more or less irregular. They generally
extend from the vicinity of the lateral incisors or the canines backward,
forming when more developed a marked bulge on each side
opposite the bicuspids, which gives the inner contour of the jaw
when looked at from above a peculiar elephantine appearance.
They may occur in the form of smooth, oblong, somewhat fusiform
swellings, or as a continuous more or less uneven ridge, or may be represented
by from one to four or five more or less rounded or flattened
hard "buttons" or tumorlike elevations. In development
they range from slight to very marked.</p>

<p>These hyperostoses have been reported by various observers (Danielli,
Søren Hansen, Rudolf Virchow, Welcker, Duckworth &amp; Pain,
Oetteking, Hrdlička, Hawkes). They received due attention by
Fürst and Hansen in their "Crania Groenlandica" (p. 178). They
have been given the convenient, though both etiologically and morphologically
inaccurate, name of "mandibular torus"; I think mandibular
hyperostoses or simply welts would be better. Fürst and
Hansen found them, taking all grades of development, in 182, or 85
per cent, of 215 lower jaws of Greenland Eskimo; in 28 jaws, or 13
per cent, they were pronounced, the remainder being slight to medium.
A special examination of 62 lower jaws of children and 710<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>

<p>The significance of these hyperostoses is not yet quite clear.
Danielli, who in 1884 reported them<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in the Ostiaks, Lapps, a
Kirghiz, a Peruvian Indian, and four white skulls, offered no explanation.
For Søren Hansen,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> who first suggested the resemblance
of these formations to the torus palatinus, "the significance of this
feature, which also occurs in other Arctic races not directly related
to the Eskimos, is not clear." R. Virchow,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who reports "wulstigen
und knolligen Hyperostosen" on both the upper and lower jaws of
a Vancouver Island Indian, restricts himself to a brief mention of the
condition with a suggestion as to its causation (see later). Welcker<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
found them in the skulls of a German (Schiller?), Lett, and a
Chinese, but has nothing to say as to their meaning. Duckworth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>and Pain<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> report the "thickening" in 10 out of 32 Eskimo jaws,
but do not discuss the causation; and the same applies to Oetteking,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
who reported on a series of Eskimo from Labrador. In 1909
Gorjanovič-Kramberger<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> somewhat indirectly notes the condition,
without a true appreciation of its meaning.</p>

<p>In 1910 I had the opportunity to report on the mandibular hyperostoses
in a rare collection of crania and lower jaws of the central
and Smith Sound Eskimo.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Of 25 lower jaws of adults and 5 of
children, 18, or 72 per cent, of the former and 2 of the latter showed
distinct to marked lingual hyperostoses, while in the remaining cases
the feature was either doubtful (absorption of the alveolar process)
or absent. Two of the five children showed the peculiarity in a
well-marked degree. A critical consideration of the condition leads
me to the conclusion that it is not pathological, and my remarks
were worded (p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>) as follows: "A marked and general feature
is a pronounced bony reinforcement of the alveolar arch extending
above the mylohyoid line from the canines or first bicuspids to or
near the last molars. This physiological hyperostosis presents more
or less irregular surface and is undoubtedly of functional origin, the
result of extraordinary pressure along the line of teeth most concerned
in chewing; yet its occurrence in infant skulls indicates that
at least to some extent the feature is already hereditary in these
Eskimo."</p>

<p>In 1912, Kajava<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> reported lingual hyperostotic thickenings on the
lower jaws of 68 adult Lapps, and found the condition in frequent
association with pronounced wear of the teeth. In 1915, finally,
Fürst and C.C. Hansen, in their great volume on "Crania Groenlandica,"
approach this question much more thoroughly. They, as
also Kajava, did not know of the writer's report of 1910. They found
the "torus" (p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>), "also in the mandibles of some various Siberian
races in a not insignificant percentage *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and also not infrequently
among European races, especially in the Laplanders
(30 to 35 per cent)." They also report the presence of the condition
"in a Chinaman," and saw indications of a good development
of it in 17 per cent of 164 middle ages to prehistoric, and in 12 per
cent of later Scandinavian lower jaws. Their interesting comments
on its possible causation, though at one point seemingly not harmonizing,
are as follows (p. <a href="#Page_180">180</a>): "The possibility is not precluded
that we have here a formation which, even though it has at first
arisen and been acquired through mechanical causes, has in the end
become a racial character, albeit a variable one." And page <a href="#Page_181">181</a>:
"There seems to be no doubt whatever that it is a formation connected
with Arctic races or Arctic conditions of life; and, accordingly, it can
not safely be assumed to be a racial character, however difficult it is
to regard it as a formation only acquired individually."</p>

<p>With both the previously published and the present data, I believe
the subject of these bony formations may now be approached with
some hope of definite conclusions.</p>

<p>These hyperostoses give no indication of being pathological. They
are formed largely, if not entirely, by compact bone tissues of evidently
normal construction. They never show a trace of attending
inflammation or of ulceration or of breaking down. They resemble
occasionally the osteomae of the vault of the skull, and more distantly
the osteomae of the auditory meatus, but in those cases
where the bony swelling is uniform and in many others they show to
be of quite a different category. (Pl. 61.)</p>

<p>As a rule these bony protuberances in the Eskimo are not connected
with evidence of pyorrhoea, root abscesses, or any other
pathological condition of the teeth, for those conditions are practically
absent in the older Eskimo skulls; therefore they can not be
ascribed to any irritation due to such conditions, and the Eskimo
have no habits that could possibly be imagined as favoring, through
mechanical irritation, the development of these bony swellings.
Wear of the teeth, which has been thought to stand possibly in a
causative relation to these developments, is common in many races
and even in animals (primates, etc.), without being accompanied
by any such formations.</p>

<p>The development of such overgrowths is not wholly limited, as
already indicated from the cases reported by Danielli (1884) and
Virchow (1889), to the lower jaw, but somewhat similar growths
may also be observed, though much more rarely, both lingually and
on the outer border of the alveolar process of the upper jaw in the
molar region. When present in the latter position they interfere
with the measurement of the external breadth of the dental arch.</p>

<p>But, if neither pathological themselves nor due to any pathological
or mechanical irritation, then these hyperostoses can only be, it would
seem, of a physiological, ontogenic nature; and if so, then they must
be brought about through a definite need and for a definite purpose
or function.</p>

<p>These views are supported by their marked symmetry, which is
very apparent even where they are irregular; by the fact that in
general they are not found in the weakest jaws (weak individuals),
or again in the largest and stoutest mandibles (jaws that are strong
enough, as it is); and by the history of their development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>Our rather extensive present data on children show that these
formations are absent in infancy. They begin to develop in older
childhood, in adolescence, or even during the earlier adult life; they
stop developing at different stages in different individuals, and they
never lead to any deformity of the body of the mandible.</p>

<p>These overgrowths are further seen to be more common and to more
frequently reach a pronounced development in the males than in the
females.</p>

<p>What is the effect of these hyperostoses? They strengthen the
dental arch. With them the arch is stronger; without them it would
be weaker. The view is therefore justified that they augment the
effectiveness of the dental arch; which is just what is needed or
would be useful in such people as the Eskimo where the demands on
the jaws exceed in general those in any other people.</p>

<p>All these appear to be facts of incontrovertible nature; but if so
then we are led to practically the same conclusion that I have reached
in the study of the central and Smith Sound Eskimo, which is that
the lingual mandibular hyperostoses are physiological formations,
developed in answer to the needs of the alveolar portions of the
lower jaw. They could be termed synergetic hyperostoses.</p>

<p>The process of the development of these strengthening deposits of
bone is probably still largely individual; yet the tendency toward
such developments appears to be already hereditary in the Eskimo,
as indicated by their beginning here and there in childhood. But
their absence in nearly one-third of the Eskimo mandibles, their
marked differences of occurrence and development in the two sexes,
and their occasional presence in the jaws of various other peoples,
including even the whites, speak against the notion of these hyperostoses
being as yet true racial features.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration, the writer is more than ever
convinced that the lingual hyperostoses of the normal lower (as well
as the upper) jaw, in the Eskimo as elsewhere, are physiological,
ontogenic developments, whose object and function is the strengthening
of the lower alveolar process in its lateral portions. Only
when excessively developed, which is very rare, they may, mechanically,
perhaps cause discomfort and thereby approach a pathological
condition.</p>

when viewed from below. (See fig. 5.) The writer would
regard these bulgings as bone buttresses built up by nature to resist
the excessive strain thrown upon the alveoli of the molar teeth. He
exhibited the mandibles to Prof. H. E. Friesell, dean of the dental

<h2>SKELETAL PARTS OTHER THAN THE SKULL</h2>


<p>The skeletal parts of the western Eskimo, outside of the skull, are
but little known. The only records are those on two skeletons (one
male, one female) from Point Barrow by Hawkes,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and those on a
few bones from Port Clarence by Cameron.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The data on the skeletal
parts of the northern and eastern Eskimo are only slightly
richer, being for the most part fragmentary and scattered.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Nor
has the time arrived yet for a comprehensive study of such material,
for notwithstanding the relative abundance in crania and the more
resistant individual skeletal parts, the securing of anywhere near
complete skeletons is very difficult. Nevertheless there is now a good
number of the long bones of the western Eskimo in the possession
of the National Museum and the main data on these, all secured
personally by the writer, will be given. They must for the present
remain essentially as so many figures without adequate discussion and
comparisons. Nevertheless a few facts appear so plainly that they
may well be pointed out before concluding this section.</p>

<p>The first fact shown by the preceding figures is the slightly greater
length of all the long bones in the midwestern and northwestern
groups as compared with those of the Bering Sea (midwestern and
southwestern). This means naturally that the people of the Seward
Peninsula and northward average somewhat taller in stature.</p>

<p>The second evident fact is that the people of the Seward Peninsula
and the more northern groups (so far as represented in these collections)
show a slightly greater stature of all the bones than the
groups farther south, showing that they were both a somewhat taller
and somewhat sturdier people.</p>

<p>The next fact of importance is the remarkable agreement in some
respects in the relative proportions of the main skeletal parts between
the people of the more southern and the more northern groups.
The males are more regular in this respect than the females. The
relative proportions of the humerus and again the tibia at their
middle are identical in the males of the southwestern and midwestern
groups and those farther northward; and the radio-humeral, humero-femoral,
and tibio-femoral indices are all very closely related. Why
there should be less agreement in these respects among the females
it is difficult to say; in all probability the series of specimens are not
sufficiently large.</p>

<p>The next table presents data and some racial comparisons. Here
the western Eskimo are taken as a unit. They are seen to considerably
resemble the Yukon Indians, but somewhat less so other Indians
in the radio-humeral and tibio-femoral indices, and they resemble all
the Indians in the relative proportions of the femur at its middle. In
other respects there are somewhat more marked differences, especially
between the western Eskimo and the Indians in general. Some irregularities
in the Yukon series may be due to insufficiency of numbers.</p>

<p>When compared with the bones of the whites and the negroes the
Eskimo and Indians separate themselves in many respects as a
distinct group, while the white and the negro bones are particularly
distinct through the greater relative thickness of the humerus and
tibia at their middle, and of the femur at its upper flattening; in
other words the Eskimo as well as the Indians are more platybrachic,
platymeric and platycnemic than the whites or the negroes.</p>

<p>The basic relation of the Eskimo to the Indian bones is quite evident;
though the Eskimo, when compared to Indians outside of
Alaska, show a relatively shorter radius and tibia, indicating the
already discussed relative shortness of the forearm and leg.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Long Bones in Eskimo and Stature</span></h3>

<p>One of the most desirable of possibilities in the anthropometry of
any people, but particularly in groups now extinct, is a correct estimation
of their stature. For this purpose the most useful aid has been
found in the long bones, and various essays have been made by Manouvrier,
Rollet, Topinard, Pearson, and others<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> at preparing tables
or arriving at methods that would enable the student to promptly
and satisfactorily obtain the stature as it was in life from the length
of the long bones. But all these essays were based on observations
on white people, and it has always been recognized that they could
not with equal confidence be applied to other racial groups. They
would in all probability be especially inapplicable to the Eskimo
with his relatively short forearms and legs; yet the possibility of
estimating the stature in many localities of the Eskimo territory,
where no living remain, would be of real value. Fortunately for this
purpose there are now some data on hand which make this possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1910, in my Contributions to the Anthropology of the Central
and Smith Sound Eskimo, I was able to report both the stature and
the length of the long bones in two normally developed adult males
and one adult female from Smith Sound. To this it is now possible to
add larger though less direct data from the group of St. Lawrence
Island. We have the stature of many of the living from this place
and also the measurements of numerous long bones from the dead
of the same group. The relations of the two are given below, together
with corresponding data from Smith Sound. There is in general
such a striking agreement in the relative proportions that the latter
may, it would seem, be used henceforth for stature estimates also in
other parts of the Eskimo region.</p>

<h2>A STRANGE GROUP OF ESKIMO NEAR POINT BARROW</h2>


<p>In 1917-1919, in the course of the John Wanamaker Expedition for
the University Museum, Philadelphia, W. B. Van Valin, with the
help of Charles Brower, the well-known local trader and collector,
excavated near Barrow a group of six tumuli, which proved in the
opinion of Van Valin to be so many old igloos, containing plentiful
cultural as well as skeletal material. The collections eventually
reached the museum, but due to lack of facilities they were in the
main never unpacked.</p>

<p>I heard of this material first from Mr. Brower, with whom I sailed
in 1926 from Barrow southward, and later with Dr. J. Alden Mason
I saw the collection still in the original boxes, at the University
Museum. In April of this year the skeletal remains were transferred
to the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, and after their transfer I
obtained the permission of Dr. Milton J. Greenman, director of the
Wistar Institute, to examine the material, which was of importance
to him in connection with his own collections from Barrow and southward.
A due acknowledgment for the privilege is hereby rendered
to both Doctor Greenman and Doctor Mason.</p>

<p>The study proved one of unexpected and uncommon interest. The
material was found to consist of two separate lots. The first of these
consisted of a considerable number of brown colored, more or less
complete skeletons with skulls, proceeding from the "igloos"; while
the second lot comprised a series of whitened isolated skulls, without
other skeletal parts and mostly even without the component lower
jaws, gathered on the tundra near Barrow. At first sight, also,
the skulls of the two groups were seen to present important
differences.</p>

<p>The "igloo" crania, while plainly pure Eskimo, proved to be of a
decidedly exceptional nature for this location. The skulls, in brief,
were not of the general western Eskimo type, but reminded at once
strongly of the skulls from Greenland and Labrador. And they were
exceptionally uniform, showing that they belonged to a definite and
distinct Eskimo group.</p>

<p>After writing of this to Doctor Mason, he kindly sent me a copy of
the notes and observations on the discovery of the material by W. B.
Van Valin, who was in charge of the excavation. The detailed notes
will soon be published by Doctor Mason. The main information they
convey is as follows:</p>

<p>The excavations by Van Valin date from 1918-19. They were made
in six large "heaps," approximately 8 miles southwest of Barrow and
about 1,000 yards back from the beach on the tundra. Two of the
heaps were on the northern and four on the southern side of a ravine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
or draw formed by a drain flowing from inland to the sea. The
Eskimo at Barrow knew nothing about these remains or their people.</p>

<p>Each of the heaps inclosed what in the excavator's opinion was an
"igloo" made of driftwood and earth; and all contained evidently
undisturbed human skeletons. The total number of bodies of all
ages was counted as 83, and they ranged from infants to old people.
There were many bird and other skins (for covers and clothing),
and numerous utensils. The hair on the bodies was in general
"black as a raven." Most of the bodies lay on "beds" of moss or
"ground willows," or rough-hewn boards. There was no indication
of any violence or sudden death. The bodies at places were in three
levels, one above the other; but there was but moderate uniformity in
the orientation of the bodies. There were found with the burials no
traces of dogs (though there were some sled runners), and no
metal, glass, pipes, labrets, nets, soapstone lamps or dog harness; but
there were bows and arrows, bolas, and ordinary pottery. The cultural
objects, Doctor Mason wrote me, resemble in a smaller measure
those of the older Bering Sea, to a larger extent those of the old
northern or "Thule" culture. There were some jadeite axes, indicating
a direct or indirect contact with Kotzebue Sound and the
Kobuk River.</p>

<p>Some of the bearskin coverings were "as bright and silvery" as
the day the bear was killed (Van Valin); and the frozen bodies were
evidently in a state of preservation approaching that of natural
mummies.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding indications to the contrary, Van Valin reached
the opinion that these remains were not those of regular burials,
though offering no other definite hypothesis.</p>

<p>Desiring additional information about this highly interesting find,
I wrote to Mr. Brower, who assisted at the excavations, and received
the following answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These mounds are from 5 to 8 miles south of the Barrow village (Utkiavik).
The largest that were opened were the farthest south, and seemed more like
raised lumps on the land than ruins. No doubt that is the reason no one had
bothered them.</p>

<p>The Eskimo have no traditions of these people. In fact they did not even
suspect the mounds contained human remains until Mr. Van Valin started to
investigate them.</p>

<p>While Van Valin thought they might be houses, I have always thought they
were burial mounds, as there seemed no family to have been together at the
time of death as often has happened. When whole families have died from some
epidemic, then the man and wife are together under their sleeping skins. In
these mounds each party was wrapped separate, either in polar bear or musk
ox skins; none were wrapped in deer skins. If male, all his hunting implements
were at his side, and if a female her working tools were with her, as
scrapers, dishes of wood, and stone knives. The men had their bows, arrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
spears, and often a heavy club, for what purpose unless used in fighting I
could not make out. At the head of each person was a small receptacle, made
of whalebone, and in it or alongside was a long wing bone that had been used
as a drinking tube. In some cases there seemed to be the remains of food in
the platters, but that was impossible to identify. Most of the bodies were laid
on the ground, a few had the remains of scrub willow under them, while only
in two or three cases had there been driftwood planks under the bodies; these
were crudely hewn with their old stone adzes.</p>

<p>There seems to have been some sort of driftwood houses over these bodies
at some time, but they decayed and have fallen on the remains, which were in
some cases embedded in the ice. Often before the frame had broken down
earth must have accumulated and covered the bodies. In these cases the flesh
has the consistency of a fine meal. While with those in the ice in some cases
part of the flesh still remained. In both cases when exposed to the air they
rapidly disintegrated, leaving nothing except the bones. By measurements they
must have been a larger race than the present people.</p>

<p>When your letter reached here I at once started making inquiries as to what
mounds were still intact; and I find that as far as known only two of the
larger ones have not been opened. The Eskimo have been opening the mounds
ever since they were found, taking from them all the hunting implements
and other material and selling them aboard the ships for curios. It seems a
shame that all this should be lost to science, and if no one takes an interest in
these places in a year or two they will all be gone.</p>

<p>I have again made inquiries as to what the present Eskimo think of these
people, but they tell me they have no tradition regarding them and that they
do not know if they were their ancestors or not. In fact, they are ignorant
of where they came from or when they died.</p>

<p>To date I do not know of any whaling implement being found with these
old people, neither is any of the framework of these mounds made from the
bones of whales. In some of the implements ivory has been used. The mounds
farthest from the shore were about 400 yards, those that remain are closer to
the beach. Some of the smaller ones are on the banks of small streams but
never very far from shore. Undoubtedly, however, they were at one time
considerably farther from the sea, but the sea is every year claiming some
of this land, especially where the banks are high along the beach. There the
beach is narrow and during a gale the waves wash out the land at its base.
This is about all that I can tell you of these people. All credit for finding
these mounds belongs to Van Valin.</p>

<p>
Yours truly,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chas. D. Brower</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p><em>The material.</em>&mdash;The collection as received at the Wistar Institute
was notable for its general dark color, enhanced in many of the
specimens by dark to black remains of the tissues. There was no
mineralization and but little bone decay, though the bones were
somewhat brittle.</p>

<p>There is a scarcity of children and adolescents; there are in fact
only two skulls of subjects less than 20 years of age in the collection.</p>

<p>The skulls and bones that remain show no violence.</p>

<p>The remains show a complete freedom from syphilis or other constitutional
disease; the only pathological condition present in some
of the bones being arthritis. This speaks strongly for their preced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ing
the contact with whites. The surface series, though smaller,
shows three syphilitic skulls. An additional fact of interest is the
absence in both the igloo and the surface series of all marks of
scurvy. Such marks are fairly common farther southward. Finally,
none of the skulls are deformed, either in life or posthumously.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Anthropological Observations and Measurements on the
Collections</span></h3>

<p><em>Age.</em>&mdash;The first observations made on the igloo material were those
as to the individual ages of the bodies. Such observations are necessarily
rough, yet within sufficiently broad limits fairly reliable. The
criteria are principally the condition of the teeth and that of the
sutures. The possible error in such estimates is, experience has
shown, as a rule well within 10 years in the older and within 5 years
in the young adults or subadults.</p>

<p>One of the objects of these observations on the "igloo" material
was to get some further light on whether the remains were those
of a group that perished of an epidemic, famine, or some other sudden
agency, or whether they represented just burials. The age distribution
of the dead would differ considerably in the two cases.</p>

<p>The above table shows the data obtained, with those on the surface
material from the same collection and known to be that of ordinary
burials.</p>

<p>The results do not agree with the composition of the living population
but are apparently near to what might be expected in burials.
Taking the sexes apart, the series from the surface shows a somewhat
more favorable condition for the men, but worse for the women.
Taking the materials, however, regardless of sex, the proportions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
ages in the earlier igloos and in the late surface burials are practically
identical. This points strongly against the idea of the igloo remains
being those of people who either died there of starvation, of an epidemic,
of being smothered, or of some other sudden affliction, and to
their having been just ordinary burials.</p>

<p>To arrive at something still more definite, if possible, I appealed
on the one hand to the United States Census and on the other to
Doctor Dublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York,
for data as to the distribution of ages among the dead, using the same
age-categories as in the case of the "igloo" material. The data furnished
by Miss E. Foudray through Dr. Wm. H. Davis, Chief Statistician
of the Bureau of the Census, are particularly to the point.
They are as follows:</p>

<p>There is a remarkable agreement of these figures with those
obtained on both the Igloo and the Barrow surface burial material,
except that for the two middle age series the figures are reversed.
This may mean an error in the two respective estimates on the Indians,
or it may mean that for these two ages the conditions among
the Eskimo concerned were better than they were in 1900 among the
Alaska Indians.</p>

<p>All the above, together with the details on the orderly treatment
of the bodies, and the absence of such conditions as were encountered
in the dead villages on St. Lawrence Island (Hooper, Nelson), inclines
one to the conclusion that the Igloo remains, however exceptional
the method for the Eskimo, were just burials.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Physical Characteristics</span></h3>

<p><em>The skull.</em>&mdash;The most noteworthy feature about the Igloo remains
is the marked distinctiveness of the skull. This strikes the observer
at the first sight of the specimens, and the impression is only strengthened
by detail examination. The skulls are very narrow, long, and
high. They differ plainly from anything except occasional individual
specimens, either about Barrow or along the rest of the west
coast of Alaska, with the possible exception of a few groups of
Seward Peninsula. They recall strongly the crania of Labrador and
south Greenland. It is the Labrador-Greenland type throughout,
men, women, and even the two children. It is a group outside of the
range of local variation. It is a strange Eskimo group, either developed
here in former times as it developed in Greenland and
Labrador, and possibly the Seward Peninsula, or one that had come
here from places where such type had already been realized.</p>

<p>The following data (the individual measurements will appear in a
later number of the Catalogue of Crania) show the differences between
the Igloo and the surface material, the latter both of the Van
Valin and of the author's collections, and the valuable Stefánsson
material, now at the American Museum, from Point Barrow. They
need but little comment. They show clearly on one hand the wholly
Eskimo nature of the Igloo skulls, and on the other their distinctness
from those of the later burials, both of Barrow and Point Barrow.
The vault especially is characteristic&mdash;narrow, long, high, more
or less keel-shaped. The face in general is much more alike in the
three groups; nevertheless its absolute height and breadth in the
Igloo series are slightly smaller than in the other two, and there
are minor differences in the orbits and the palate.</p>

The size of the series is such that they are nicely comparable. And
to the two is added a small recent series (A. H., 1926, and Collins,
1928), from Golovnin Bay and Sledge Island (Seward Peninsula).</p>

<p>A comparison of the Igloo and Greenland series shows striking
similarities; hardly any two geographically separate groups originating
from a single source could reasonably be expected to come nearer.
The Igloo skulls are even narrower in the vault than the Greenlanders,
which means so much farther away from the southwestern,
midwestern, and Asiatic Eskimo; and offer a few other differences,
but all these are of small moment, not affecting the essential relations
of the two groups.</p>

<p>A comparison of the Igloo and Greenland series with the material
from Golovnin Bay and Sledge Island shows also numerous similarities
but with them some rather material differences. The differences
are especially marked in the females, whose characteristics approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
more those of the midwestern Eskimo, which suggests that an important
proportion of them may have been derived from the latter.
However, even the males tend to differ. Both sexes show absolutely
a somewhat broader skull than that of the northerners; in both sexes
the skull, as seen from the cranial module, is slightly larger in the
Seward Peninsula series than in either of the other groups; but the
principal differences are seen in the face, which in the Seward
Peninsula group is perceptibly larger and especially higher than it
is in either the Igloo or the Greenland series. The orbits also in the
southerners are larger and the nose is slightly higher.</p>

<p>On the whole it may be said that the resemblance of the Igloo
crania to those of Greenland is closer than that to either or both of
the series of Golovnin Bay and Sledge Island. This suggests the
possibility that a similar though not quite the same differentiation in
the skull may have taken place both in the Seward Peninsula and in
the far north; though the possibility of a derivation of any one of
the three groups from any of the others can not be discarded. So
far as the skull is concerned a definite solution of the identity of the
Igloo material would have to be, it would seem, postponed to the
future.</p>

<p>The used data on the Greenland Eskimo skulls agree closely with
those of Fürst and Hansen (Crania Groenlandica, fol., 1915), and
also with the much fewer and scattered records of Virchow, Davis,
Duckworth, Oetteking, Pittard, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> on Eskimo skulls from
Labrador.</p>

<p><em>Stature and strength.</em>&mdash;The bones of the skeleton of the Igloo series
show the people to have been of good height and of above medium
Eskimo robustness. The principal measurements are given below,
together with the corresponding ones on the western and the Yukon
Eskimo. The material is not all that could be wished for, either in
numbers or representation, but it will suffice for rough comparisons.
Regrettably nothing for comparison is available as yet from Greenland
or other parts of the far northeast where we meet with long,
narrow, and high skulls.</p>

<p>The above table shows some remarkable and interesting conditions.</p>

<p>The first of the most apparent facts is that the type of the Yukon
Eskimo stands well apart from both of the other series in a number
of essentials, showing that it is not very nearly related and that it
may be left out of consideration.</p>

<p>On the other hand the long bones from the Seward Peninsula and
the northwest coast, especially those of the males, show very closely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
those of the Igloo group. The male bones of the two series are almost
identical, except that the Igloo bones are somewhat stronger.</p>

<p>Such close resemblances can hardly be fortuitous. They speak
strongly for the basic identity of the old Igloo people with those of at
least parts of the Seward Peninsula and parts of the northwest
coast. If we take the bones from the Seward Peninsula alone (see
p. <a href="#Page_314">314</a>) it is found that these resemblances still hold.</p>

<p>The evidence thus shown constitutes a strong indication that the
old Igloo group may be inherently related to that part of the Eskimo
population of Seward Peninsula which shows the long and narrow
skull; but the data offer no light on the questions as to whether the
Igloo group may have been derived from that of the Seward Peninsula
or vice versa, and on the true relation of either or both of these to
the Eskimo of Baffin Land, Greenland, and Labrador.</p>

<p>To definitely decide the problem of the Igloo group there are needed
data on the long bones of the northeasterners; in the second place it
is highly desirable to know how large and how ancient was the group
of the narrow-headed people on the Seward Peninsula and Sledge
Island; and in the third place it is important that the cultural history
of the two groups be known as thoroughly as possible. All of which
are tasks for the future.</p>

<p>The possibility of a development of the Igloo cranial type on the
northwest coast itself can not be denied, in view of the facts that
all its characteristics are within the ranges of normal individual
variations on that coast, and that similar developments have evidently
been realized elsewhere. But in such a case it would be
logical to expect, locally or not far away, some ancestry of the group,
and the group would not probably be limited to a little spot and a
few scores of persons. Had the group developed incidentally from
a physically exceptional family, it could not be expected to have
been anywhere nearly as uniform as the group under consideration.
The high degree of uniformity of the Igloo contingent speaks for
a well accomplished differentiation; and as there is no other trace of
this in the conditions near Barrow, and there are no ruins denoting
a long occupation, the evidence is against a local development and
for an immigration of the group. A coming of a small-sized contingent
from the Seward Peninsula would be easy; its coming from
Greenland or Labrador or Baffin Land would surely be difficult, but
not impossible to the Eskimo, who is known to have been a traveler.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the eventual solution of the Igloo problem, it is
plain that the presence of that group near Barrow, together with the
presence of evidently closely related groups in a part of the Seward
Peninsula and again in the far east of the Eskimo region, offers much
food for thought and investigation. The most plausible possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
would seem to be a relatively late (within the present millennium)
coming of a physically already well differentiated small group, from
either the south or the east, with a relatively short settlement at the
Barrow site, some local multiplication in numbers, and then extinction
partly through disease, partly perhaps through absorption into
a stronger and newer contingent derived from the western people.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF THE ESKIMO</h2>


<p>All anthropological research on the Eskimo has naturally one ultimate
object, which is the clearing up of the problems of the origin
and antiquity of this highly interesting human strain; and it may
well be asked what further light on these problems has been shed
by the studies here dealt with. To show this with a proper perspective
it will be requisite to briefly review the previous ideas on these
problems.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Origin of the Name "Eskimo"</span></h3>

<p>According to Charlevoix (Nouv. France, III, 178), the term
"Eskimo" is a corruption of the Abenaki Indian Esquimantsic or
the Ojibway Ashkimeg, both terms meaning "those who eat raw
flesh." In the words of Captain Hooper,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> "Neither the origin nor
meaning of the name 'Esquimaux,' or Eskimo, as it is now spelled,
is known. According to Doctor Rink, the name 'Esquimaux' was
first given to the inhabitants of Southern Labrador as a term of derision
by the inhabitants of Northern Labrador, and means raw-fish
eater. Dall says the appellation 'Eskimo' is derived from a word
indicating a sorcerer or shaman in the language of the northern
tribes."</p>

<p>For Brinton,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> as for Charlevoix, the term "Eskimo" is derived
from the Algonkin "Eskimantick," "eaters of raw flesh." According
to Chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Sir John Richardson (Arctic Searching Exp.,
p. 203) attempts to derive it from the French words ceux qui miaux
(miaulent), referring to their clamorous outcries on the approach
of a ship. Petitot (Chambers Encyc., Ed. 1880, IV, p. 165, article
Esquimaux) says that at the present day the Crees, of Lake Athabasca,
call them Wis-Kimowok (from Wiyas flesh, aski raw, and
mowew to eat), and also Ayiskimiwok (i. e., those who act in secret).
In Labrador the English sometimes call the Eskimo "Huskies" (loc.
cit., p. ix. 7. Chambers Encyc., article Esquimaux. See Hind. Trav.
in Int. of Labr., loc. cit., and Petitot loc. cit., p. ix.) and Suckemos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>(Richardson, Arctic Searching Expedition, p. 202) and Dall (Proc.
Am. Ass. Adv. Sci., 1869, p. 266) says that in Alaska the Tinneh
Indians call them "Uskeeme" (sorcerers).</p>

<p>The Eskimo call themselves "Innuit," said to be the plural of
in-nu, the man, hence "the people"; the same being as a rule the
meaning of the name by which the various tribes of the Indian call
themselves.</p>

<p>On the Asiatic coast the Eskimo is known as the "Yuit," "Onkilon,"
"Chouklouks," or "Namollo"; while in the east appears the

<h3><span class="smcap">Opinions By Former and Living Students</span></h3>

<p><em>Origin in Asia.</em>&mdash;Many opinions on the origin of the Eskimo have
been expressed by different authors. Among the earliest of these
were those of missionaries, such as Crantz (1779), and of the early
explorers, such as Steller, v. Wrangell, Lütke and others. They were
based on the general aspect of the Eskimo, particularly that of his
physiognomy; and seeing that in many features he resembled most
the mongoloid peoples of Asia they attached him to these, which
meant the conclusion that he was of Asiatic derivation. Quite soon,
however, there began to appear also the opinions of students of man.
The first of these was that of Blumenbach, as expressed in his Inaugural
Thesis of 1781. In this thesis, more particularly its second
edition, he classifies the Eskimo expressly as a part of the Caucasian
or white race. But after obtaining an Eskimo skull and an Eskimo
body he changes his opinion and in 1795-1806 he comes out with a
definite classification of the Eskimo as a member of the Mongolians;
and a similar conclusion, with its implied or expressed consequence
of a migration from Asia to America, has been reached since, mainly
on somatological but also in part on linguistic and cultural bases,
by a large number of authors, including Lawrence, Morton, Pickering,
Latham, Flower, Peschel, Topinard, Brinton, Virchow (1877),
Quatrefages and Hamy (1882), Thalbitzer, Bogoras and numerous
others. With all of this, the conception of the Asiatic origin of the
Eskimo has not passed the status of a strong probability, lacking a
final conclusive demonstration.</p>

<p>A chronological list of the more noteworthy individual statements
is given at the end of this section.</p>

<p><em>Origin in America.</em>&mdash;Since the earlier parts of the nineteenth
century the opinion began to be expressed that the Eskimo is not of
Asiatic but of American origin. Already in 1847 Prichard tells us
that there are those who "consider them as belonging to the American
family," and he plainly favors this conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>Between 1873 and 1890 the American origin of the Eskimo is repeatedly
asserted by Rink, who for 16 winters and 22 summers lived
with the eastern Eskimo, first as a scientific explorer and later as
royal inspector or governor of the southern Danish settlements in
Greenland (preface by R. Brown to Rink's Tales and Traditions,
1875). In this opinion, briefly, the Eskimo were derived from the
inland Indian tribes of Alaska; without referring to the origin of the
Indian.</p>

<p>Rink's authoritative opinion was followed or paralleled by Daniel
Wilson (1876), Grote, Krause, Ray, Keane, Brown, and others. In
1887 Chamberlain expresses the somewhat startling additional theory
that it was not the Eskimo who was derived from the Mongolians
but the Mongolians from the Eskimo or their American ancestors.
And in 1901-1910 Boas comes to the conclusion that the Eskimo
probably originated from the inland tribes (Indian?) in the Hudson
Bay region.</p>

<p>An interesting case in these connections is that of Rudolf Virchow.
In 1877 (see details at the end of this section) he expresses the belief
in the Eskimo coming from Asia; in 1878 he seems to be uncertain;
and in 1885 he comes out in support of the opinion that the original
home of the Eskimo may have been in the western part of the Hudson
Bay region. Among later students of the problem, Steensby<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and
Birket-Smith<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> incline on cultural grounds to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Wissler, not explicit as to the Eskimo in 1917 (The American Indian),
in 1918 (Archæology of the Polar Eskimo) finds, after
Steensby, the most acceptable theory of the Eskimo origin to be that
"they expanded from a parent group in the Arctic Archipelago";
but in 1922, in the second edition of his The American Indian, he
repeats word for word his opinion of 1917, which appears to favor
an Asiatic derivation.</p>

<p><em>Origin in Europe&mdash;Identity with Upper Palaeolithic man.</em>&mdash;About
the sixties of last century growing discoveries in France of implements,
etc., of later palaeolithic man brought about a realization that
not a few of these implements and other objects, particularly those
of the Magdalenian period, resembled like implements and objects
of the Eskimo; from which, together with the considerations of the
similarities of fauna (reindeer, musk-ox, etc.), and of climate, there
was but a step to a more or less definite identification of the Magdalenians
and Solutreans with the Eskimo. In 1870 Pruner-Bey<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
claims a similarity between Solutrean and Eskimo skulls. In 1883
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>these views received the influential support of De Mortillet (see
details). In 1889 the theory receives strong support from the characteristics
of the Chancelade (Magdalenian) skeleton which Testut
declares are in many respects almost identical with those of the
Eskimo. And within the next few years the notion is upheld by
Hamy and Hervé. It remains sympathetic as late as 1913 to Marcellin
Boule, and finds most recent champions in Morin and Sollas.</p>

<p>However, there were also many who opposed the effort at a direct
connection of the upper palaeolithic man of Europe and the Eskimo.
Among these were Geikie, Flower, Rae, Daniel Wilson, Robert
Brown, Déchelette, Laloy. At present the theory is supported
mainly by Morin and Sollas, opposed by Steensby, Burkitt, Keith,
MacCurdy, and others; while most students of the Eskimo ignore
the question.</p>

<p><em>Other hypotheses.</em>&mdash;Besides the preceding ideas which attribute
the origin of the Eskimo to Asia, or America, or old Europe, there
were also others that failed to receive a wider support; and there
were authors and students who remained undecided or were too
cautious to definitely formulate their beliefs. Some of the former
as well as the latter deserve brief mention.</p>

<p>Gallatin, in 1836, mainly on linguistic grounds, recognizes the
fundamental relation of the Eskimo and the Indian and seems inclined
to the American origin of the former, but makes no clear statement
to that effect. For Meigs (1857), who probably followed an
earlier opinion, the Eskimo came "from the islands of the Polar
Sea." C. C. Abbott (1876) saw Eskimo in the early inhabitants of
the Delaware Valley. To Grote (1875, 1877), the Eskimo were "the
existing representatives of the man of the American glacial epoch";
they were modified Pliocene men. Nordenskiöld (1885) follows
closely Meigs and Grote; the Eskimo may be "the true autochthones
of the Polar regions," having inhabited them from before the glacial
age, during more genial climate. Keane (1886) believed the Eskimo
developed from the Aleuts. For De Quatrefages (1887), man originated
in the Tertiary in northern Asia, spread from there, and some
of his contingents may have reached America and been the ancestors
of the Eskimo; the western tribes of the latter being a mixture of the
Eskimo with Asiatic brachycephals. Nansen (1893) avoids a discussion
of the origin of the Eskimo; and the same caution is observable
more or less in most modern writers.</p>

<p>The following chart of the more noteworthy opinions regarding
the origin of the Eskimo will show at a glance the diversity of the
views and their lack of conclusiveness.</p>

their product) to the Kalmuks, Yakuts, Tungus, and Kamchadales,

through Tartary to the farthest northeast of Asia and then to
America).</p>

<p>But in his "Beiträge zur Naturgeschichte," 2d ed., Göttingen,

Mongolians (Anthr. Treatises of Blumenbach, Lond., 1865, p. 304):
"The remaining Asiatics, except the Malays, with the Lapps in
Europe, and the Esquimaux in the north of America, from Bering
Strait to Labrador and Greenland. They are for the most part of
a wheaten yellow, with scanty, straight, black hair, and have flat
faces with laterally projecting cheek bones, and narrowly slit
eyelids."</p>

from the eastward, over the ocean which intervenes between Lapland

Spitzbergen, Iceland, or Jan Mayen. We look at them and see at
once that they have no kinship with the red race of America; but a

umgekehrt, annehmen, und hierfür finden wir ausser den allgemeinen
Gründen, welche uns der Verlauf unserer Untersuchungen nahe

können wir die Spur ihrer Wanderungen historisch verfolgen, und
diese wären nach Osten gerichtet, sodass sie Grönland, mit dem
heute ihr Name so eng verbunden ist, zuletzt erreichten (S. 209);
sodann haben die Eskimo allein unter den Americanischen Stämmen

that America was peopled from Asia originally, and that there
were successive waves of emigration.</p>

<p>"The northern route was clearly by way of Bering
Strait; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Linguistically, no ultimate distinction can be drawn between
the American Innuit and the American Indian. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I
shall assume, what is also assumed by Mr. Markham, that the original
progenitors of the Innuit were in a very primitive, low, and
barbarous condition. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"I assume, then, that the larger part of North America may have
been peopled by way of Bering Strait. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I believe that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>emigration was vastly more ancient than Mr. Markham supposes, and
that it took place before the present characteristics of races and
tribes of North American savages were developed. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"My own impression agrees with that of Doctor Rink that the
Innuit were once inhabitants of the interior of America; that they
were forced to the west and north by the pressure of tribes of Indians
from the south; that they spread into the Aleutian region and
northwest coast generally, and possibly simultaneously to the north;
that their journeying was originally tentative, and that they finally
settled in those regions which afforded them subsistence, perhaps
after passing through the greater portion of Arctic America, leaving
their traces as they went in many places unfit for permanent settlement;
that after the more inviting regions were occupied, the pressure
from Indians and still unsatisfied tribes of their own stock, induced
still further emigration, and finally peopled Greenland and the
shores of northeastern Siberia; but that these latter movements were,
on the whole, much more modern, and more local than the original
exodus, and took place after the race characteristics and language
were tolerably well matured. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"I conclude that at present the Asiatic Innuit range from Koliuchin
Bay to the eastward and south to Anadyr Gulf. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"To the reflux of the great wave of emigration, which no doubt
took place at a very early period, we may owe the numerous deserted
huts reported by all explorers on the north coasts of Asia, as far east
as the mouth of the Indigirka. At one time, I thought the migration
to Asia had taken place within a few centuries, but subsequent study
and reflection has convinced me that this could not have been the
case. No doubt successive parties crossed at different times, and some
of these may have been comparatively modern."</p>

own country in the northern parts of Asia by some unknown pressure
of circumstances, and obliged to extend themselves along the whole
northern coast line of America and Greenland, appears to be likely,
and that the route followed after crossing Bering Strait was of necessity
along the coast eastward, being hemmed in by hostile Indians on
the south, and driven forward by pressure from the west *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

physical characteristics of the Eskimos led him to agree entirely
with Doctor Rae's conclusions derived from other sources. He looked
upon the Eskimos as a branch of the North Asiatic Mongols (of
which the Japanese may be taken as a familiar example), who in
their wandering across the American continent in the eastward direction,
isolated almost as perfectly as an island population would be,
hemmed in on one side by the eternal polar ice, and on the other by
hostile tribes of American Indians, with whom they rarely, if ever,
mingled, have gradually developed special modifications of the Mongolian
type, which increase in intensity from west to east, and are
seen in their greatest perfection in the inhabitants of Greenland.

to types from the Central Eskimo finds. There all the conditions
have been present for the originating of such a culture, and from
there it has spread eastward right to Greenland, seeking everywhere
to adapt itself to the local geographical conditions. And it can

climate of the Eskimo regions not to have altered in any remarkable
way since they were first inhabited, their inhabitants of course must
originally have come from more southern latitudes, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* it appears
evident on many grounds that such a southern tribe has not been
a coast people migrating along the seashore, and turning into Eskimo
on passing beyond a certain latitude, but that they have more probably
emerged from some interior country, following the river banks
toward the shores of the polar sea, having reached which they became
a coast people, and, moreover, a polar-coast people. The Eskimo
most evidently representing the polar-coast people of North America,
the first question which arises seems to be whether their development
can be conjectured with any probability to have taken place in that
part of the world. Other geographical conditions appear greatly to
favor such a supposition *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. The rivers taking their course to
the sea between Alaska and the Coppermine River, seem well adapted
to lead such a migrating people onward to the polar sea. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"The probable identity of the 'inlanders' with the Indians has already
been remarked on. When the new coast people began to spread
along the Arctic shores, some bands of them may very probably have
crossed Bering Strait and settled on the opposite shore, which is
perhaps identical with the fabulous country of Akilinek. On the
other hand, there is very little probability that a people can have
moved from interior Asia to settle on its polar seashore, at the same
time turning Eskimo, and afterwards almost wholly emigrated to
America.</p>

<p>"On comparing the Eskimo with the neighboring nations, their
physical complexion certainly seems to point at an Asiatic origin;
but, as far as we know, the latest investigations have also shown a
transitional link to exist between the Eskimo and the other American
nations, which would sufficiently indicate the possibility of a common
origin from the same continent."</p>

for 20 years, and has studied the native traditions, of which
he has preserved a collection, considers the Eskimo as deserving
particular attention in regard to the question how America has been
originally peopled. He desires to draw the attention of ethnologists
to the necessity of explaining, by means of the mysterious early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>history of the Eskimo, the apparently abrupt step by which these
people have been changed from probably inland or riverside inhabitants
into a decidedly littoral people, depending entirely on the
products of the Arctic Sea; and he arrives at the conclusion that,
although the question must still remain doubtful, and dependent
chiefly on further investigations into the traditions of the natives
occupying adjacent countries, yet, as far as can now be judged, the
Eskimo appear to have been the last wave of an aboriginal American
race, which has spread over the continent from more genial regions,
following principally the rivers and watercourses, and continually
yielding to the pressure of the tribes behind them, until at last they
have peopled the seacoast. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"When we consider the existing intercourse between the inhabitants
on both sides of Bering Strait, we find many circumstances to
justify the conclusion that those traditions of the Greenland Eskimo
refer to the origin of the Eskimo sledge dog from the training of
the Arctic wolf, to the first journeys upon the frozen sea, and to
intercourse between the aboriginal Eskimo and the Asiatic coast."</p>

Asia by Bering Strait or the Aleutian Islands; and more probably
by the latter than the former. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"In this direction, then, a North American germ of population
may have entered the continent from Asia, diffused itself over the
Northwest, and ultimately reached the valleys of the Mississippi, and
penetrated to southern latitudes by a route to the east of the Rocky
Mountains. Many centuries may have intervened between the first

ancient date. But so far as I have been able to study the evidence,
much of that hitherto adduced appears to point the other

to the dividing sea; and the islands of the whole Aleutian group in
the occupation of the same remarkable stock common to both hemispheres:

has hitherto been imagined possible. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*"</p>

<p>"That they have followed the receding line of ice, which at one
time capped the northern part of this continent, along the easiest
lines of travel is shown in the general distribution of a similar people,
speaking a similar tongue, from Greenland to Bering Strait; in
so doing they followed the easiest natural lines of travel along the
watercourses and the seashore, and the distribution of the race to-day
marks the routes traveled. The seashore led them along the
Labrador and Greenland coasts; Hudson Bay and its tributary

some of the coast to the south of the mouth of the Yukon, and a few
drifted across Bering Strait on the ice, and their natural traits are
still in marked contrast with their neighbors, the Chuckchee. They
use dogs instead of deer, the natives of North America having never
domesticated the reindeer, take their living from the sea, and speak a
different tongue. Had the migration come from Asia it does not

Deutsche Geographische Blätter (Bermen, 1886) *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* makes
it sufficiently evident that their primeval home must be placed in
the extreme northwest, on the Alaskan shores of the Bering Sea
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the Aleutian Islanders, who are treated by Doctor Rink as a
branch of the Eskimo family, but whose language diverges profoundly
from, or rather shows no perceptible affinity at all to, the
Eskimo. The old question respecting the ethnical affinities of the
Aleutians is thus again raised, but not further discussed by our
author. To say that they must be regarded as 'ein abnormer
Seitenzweig,' merely avoids the difficulty, while perhaps obscuring
or misstating the true relations altogether. For these islanders
should possibly be regarded, not 'as abnormal offshoot,' but as the
original stock from which the Eskimos themselves have diverged.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Doctor Rink himself advances some solid reasons for bringing
the Eskimo, not from Asia at all, or at least not in the first
instance, but from the interior of the North American continent. He
holds, in fact, with some other ethnologists, that they were originally
inlanders, who, under pressure from the American Indians, gradually
advanced along the course of the Yukon, Mackenzie, and other
great rivers, to their present homes on the Bering Sea, and Frozen
Ocean."</p>

people, with a meridional range greater than that of any other
race. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"It is also clear that this migration has always been from west to
east, as also has been that of the Indian tribes; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Did these hyperboreans come from Asia or are they evolutions,
differentiations, as it were, of some of the other American races?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>That all of the American peoples came originally from Asia, is, I
think, an hypothesis for which a great deal might be said. Unless
they originated there or were autochthonic, an idea which may at
once be dismissed; they could scarcely have come from anywhere
else, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but the central question is whether the Eskimo are of a
later date than the Indians or are really Indians compelled to live
under less favorable conditions than the rest of their kinsfolk. The
latter will, I think, be found to be the most reasonable view to
adopt. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"Doctor Rink seems not far from the truth when he indicates
the rivers of Central Arctic America as the region from whence the
Eskimo spread northward. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"It is not at all improbable that the original progenitors of the
race may have been a few isolated families, members of some small
Indian tribe, or the decaying remnants of a larger one. Little by
little they were expelled from their hunting and fishing grounds on
the original river bank until, finding no place amid the stronger
tribes, they settled in a region where they were left to themselves.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"It may, however, be taken as proved that the Eskimo are in no
respect and never were a European people; that they are not and
never were an Asiatic one, except to the small extent already described;
that the handful of people settled on the Siberian shore
migrated from America, and that it is very probable the Eskimo
came from the interior of Arctic America, Alaska more likely than
from any other part of the world."</p>

the culture of the Alaskan Eskimo is very greatly influenced by that
of the Indians of the North Pacific coast and by the Athapascan
tribes of the interior. This is in accord with the observation that
their physical type is not so pronounced as the eastern Eskimo type.
I believe, therefore, that H. Rink's opinion of an Alaskan origin of
the Eskimo is not very probable. If pure type and culture may be
considered as significant, I should say that the Eskimo west and
north of Hudson Bay have retained their ancient characteristics more
than any others. If their original home was in Alaska, we must add
the hypothesis that their dispersion began before contact with the
Indians. If their home was east of the Mackenzie, the gradual dispersion
and ensuing contact with other tribes would account for all
the observed phenomena. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* On the whole, the relations of
North Pacific and North Asiatic cultures are such that it seems
plausible to my mind that the Alaskan Eskimo are, comparatively
speaking, recent intruders, and that they at one time interrupted an
earlier cultural connection between the two continents."</p>

adopted maritime pursuits, which, however, were kept entirely
apart from their inland life, although in a way this seems an attractive

<h4>EUROPEAN</h4>

<p>Dawkins, 1866:<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> "The sum of the evidence proves that man, in a
hunter state, lived in the south of Gaul on reindeer, musk sheep,
horses, oxen, and the like, at a time when the climate was similar to
that which those animals now inhabit. To what race did he belong?
In solving this the zoological evidence is of great importance. The
reindeer and musk sheep now inhabit the northern part of the
American Continent and are the principal land animals that supply
the Esquimaux with food. The latter of these has departed from
the Asiatic Continent, leaving remains behind to prove that it shared
the higher northern latitudes of Asia with the reindeer, and this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>latter has retreated farther and farther north during the historical
period. May not the race that lived on these two animals in southern
Gaul have shared also in their northern retreat, and may it not be
living in company with them still? The truth of such a hypothesis
as this is found by an appeal to the weapons, implements, and
habits of life of the Esquimaux. The fowling spear, the harpoon,
the scrapers, the marrow spoons are the same in the ice huts of Melville
Sound as in the ancient dwellings of southern Gaul. In both
there is the same absence of pottery; in both bones are crushed in the
same way for the sake of the marrow, and accumulate in vast quantities.
The very fact of human remains being found among the relics
of the feast is explained by an appeal to what Captain Parry observed
in the island of Igloolik. Among the vast quantities of bones
of walruses and seals, and skulls of dogs and bears found in the Esquimaux
camp, were numbers of human skulls lying about among the
rest, which the natives tumbled into the collecting bags of the officers
without the least remorse. A similar carelessness for the dead was
also observed by Sir J. Ross and Captain Lyon. This presence, then,
of human remains in the south of Gaul is another link binding the
ancient people then living there to the Esquimaux. Their small size
also is additional evidence.</p>

<p>"The only inference that can be drawn from these premises is
that the people in question were decidedly Esquimaux, related to
them precisely in the same way as the reindeer and musk sheep of
those days were to those now living in the high North American
latitudes. The sole point of difference is the possession of the dog
by the latter people, but in the vast lapse of time between the date
of their sojourn in Europe and the present day the dog might very
well have been adopted from some other superior race, or even reduced
under the rule of man from some wild progenitor. By this
discovery a new people is added to those which formerly dwelt in
Europe. The severity of the climate in southern Gaul is proved by
the northern animals above mentioned. As it became warmer musk
sheep, reindeer, and Esquimaux would retreat farther and farther
north until they found a resting place on the American shore of the
great Arctic Sea. Possibly in the case of the Esquimaux the immigration
of other and better-armed tribes might be a means of accelerating
this movement."</p>

were close kin to the palaeolithic man of Europe, before the scientific
forum. In his Cave Hunting he says: "Palaeolithic man appeared
in Europe with the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe along with
them, and disappeared with them. And since his implements are of
the same kind as those of the Eskimos, it may reasonably be concluded
that he is represented at the present time by the Eskimos, for
it is most improbable that the convergence of the ethnological and
zoological evidence should be an accident."</p>

western American Eskimo. The language does not extend in Asia
beyond that tribe. That of their immediate neighbors, the "Reindeer,"
or "Wandering Tchuktchi," is totally different and belongs
to the Kouriak family.</p>

<p>"There does not seem to be any solid foundation for the opinion
of those who would ascribe to the Eskimaux an origin different from
that of the other Indians of North America. The color and features
are essentially the same; and the differences which may exist, particularly
that in stature, may be easily accounted for by the rigor
of the climate and partly, perhaps, by the nature of their food. The
entire similarity of the structure and grammatical forms of their

fairly and ably stated by Doctor Latham in his recent work On
the Varieties of Man, to which I must refer the reader; and I shall
merely remark that the Eskimos differ more in physical aspect from
their nearest neighbors than the red races do from one another. The
lineaments have a decided resemblance to the Tartar or Chinese countenance.
On the other hand, their language is admitted by philologists
to be similar to the other North American tongues in its
grammatical structure; so that, as Doctor Latham has forcibly stated,
the dissociation of the Eskimos from their neighboring nations on
account of their physical dissimilarity is met by an argument for
their mutual affinity, deduced from philological coincidences."</p>

the locality where they had undergone their original modification.

<p>Baron Nordenskiöld<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> thought that the Eskimo might probably
be the true "autochthones" of the polar regions, i. e., that they had
inhabited the same previous to the glacial age, at a period when a
climate prevailed here equal to that of northern Italy at present, as
proved by the fossils found at Spitzbergen and Greenland. As it
might be assumed that man had existed even during the Tertiary
period, there was a great deal in favor of the assumption that he had
lived in those parts which were most favorable to his existence. The
question was one of the highest importance, as, if it could be proved
that the Eskimo descended from a race which inhabited the polar
regions in the very earliest times, we should be obliged to assume
that there was a northern (polar) as well as an Asiatic cradle of the
human race, which would open up new fields of research, both to the
philologist and the ethnologist, and probably remnants of the culture
and language of the original race might be traced in the present polar
inhabitants of both Europe and Asia.</p>

<h4>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS INDICATED BY PRESENT DATA</h4>

<p>The maze of thoughts on the origin of the Eskimo shows one fact
conclusively, which is that the necessary evidence on the subject has
hitherto been insufficient. From whatever side the problem has
been approached, whether linguistically, culturally, from the study
of myths, or even somatologically, the materials were, it is plain,
more or less inadequate and there was not enough for satisfactory
comparisons. The best contributions to Eskimo studies, from the
oldest to the most recent, all accentuate the need for further research,
and more ample collections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>Another point is that heterogeneous and wide apart as many of the
opinions may seem, yet when the subject is looked upon with a
larger perspective they may often perhaps be harmonized. Thus a
belief in an American origin of the Eskimo need not exclude that in
the Asiatic derivation of his parental stock. Even in the case of the
supposed European derivation the Eskimo are understood to have
reached America through Asia; there is not one suggestion of any
importance advocating the coming of the Eskimo over northwestern
Europe and Iceland. Only the Meigs-Grote-Nordenskiöld theory of
an ancient polar race and its descent southward appears now as
beyond the bounds of what would be at least partly justifiable.</p>

<p>What is the contribution to the subject of the studies reported in
this treatise, with its relatively great amount of somatological material?
The answer is not easy.</p>

<p>Even the truly great and precious material at hand is not sufficient.
There are important parts of the Arctic, such as the Hudson Bay
region, Baffin Land, and the central region; several parts of the west
coast, such as the inland waters of the Seward Peninsula and the
Eskimo portions of the Selawik, Kobuk, Noatak, and Yukon Rivers;
and above all the Eskimo part of northeastern Siberia, from which
there are insufficient or no collections. There is, moreover, especially
in this country, a great want of skeletal material from the
non-Eskimo Siberian tribes, and also from the old European peoples that are
of most importance for comparisons. It must be plain, therefore,
that even at present no final deductions are possible. All that can
be claimed for the evidence here brought forth is that it clears, or
tends to settle, certain secondary problems, and that it presents indications
of value for the rest of the question.</p>

<p>The secondary problems that may herewith be regarded as settled
are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <em>Unity or plurality of the race.</em>&mdash;The materials at hand give no
substantiation to the possibility of the Eskimo belonging to more than
one basic strain of people. They range in color from tan or light
reddish-yellow to medium brown; in stature from decidedly short
to above the general human medium; in head from brachycephalic
and low to extremely dolichocephalic, high and keel shaped; in eyes
from horizontal to decidedly mongoloid; in orbits from microseme
to hypermegaseme; in nose from fully mesorrhinic to extremely
leptorrhinic; in physiognomy from pure "Indian" to extreme
"Eskimo." Yet all through there runs, both in the living and in
the skeletal remains, so much of a basic identity that no separation
into any distinct original "races" is possible. At most it is permissible
to speak of a few prevalent types.</p>

<p>2. <em>Relation.</em>&mdash;The general basic prototype of the Eskimo, according
to all evidence, is so closely akin to that of the Indian that the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
can not be fully separated. They appear only as the thumb and the
digits of the same hand, some large old mother stock from which
both gradually differentiated. This appears to be an unavoidable
conclusion from the present anthropological knowledge of the two
peoples.</p>

<p>The next unavoidable deduction is that the mother stock of both
the Eskimo and the Indian can only be identified with the great
yellow-brown stem of man, the home of which was in Asia, but the
roots of which, as has been discussed elsewhere, were probably in
ancient (later paleolithic) Europe.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The latter fact may explain the
cultural as well as somatological resemblances between the Eskimo,
as well as the Indian (for the Indian, physically at least, has much
in common with the upper Aurignacians), and the upper glacial
European populations. But such an explanation can not in the
light of present knowledge legitimately be extended to the assumption
that either the Indian complex or the Eskimo originated as
such in Europe; they could be at most but parts of the eventual more
or less further differentiated Asiatic progeny of the upper paleolithic
Europeans.</p>

<p>3. <em>Mixture.</em>&mdash;It has been assumed by Boas and others that the
eastern Eskimo have become admixed with the eastern Indian and
the western with the Alaskan Indian, that the physical and especially
craniological differences between the eastern and western Eskimo were
due to such a mixture, and that both extremes deviated from the type
of the pure Eskimo, who was to be found somewhere in the central
Arctic. The evidence of the present studies does not sustain such an
assumption.</p>

<p>As shown before<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and is seen more clearly from the present data,
the western Eskimo type is also present or approached in various
localities in the far north (part of Smith Sound, Southampton
Island, part of the Hudson Bay coast, with probable spots in the
central Arctic proper). There is no indication of any central region
where the western Eskimo type would be much "purer" than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Individual skulls and skeletons in the west, particularly in certain
spots (especially on Seward Peninsula), show the same characteristics
as the most diverging skulls or skeletons in the farthest
northeast.</p>

<p>And both in the west and in the east the most pronounced Eskimo
characteristics exceed similar features in the Indian, indicating independent
development. Such characteristics involve the stature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>(taller in the west, shorter in the east than that of the Indian); the
size of the head (everywhere averaging higher in the Eskimo);
dolichocephaly, height of the head, its keel shape (all more pronounced
in the eastern and now and then a western Eskimo than in
any Indian group); the face, nose, orbits, and lower jaw; with the
relative proportions and other characteristics of the skeleton. All
these point to functional and other developments within the Eskimo
groups and none suggest a large Indian admixture.</p>

<p>It is well known that more or less blood mixture takes place among
all neighboring peoples where contact is possible, even if otherwise
there be much enmity. Such enmity, often in an extreme form, existed
everywhere it seems between the Eskimo and the Indian, as a
result of the encroaching of the former on the latter; there are many
statements to that effect. Within historic times also there are no
records of any adoptions or intermarriages between the two peoples.
Nevertheless where contact took place, as on the rivers and in the
southwest as well as the southeast of the Eskimo territory, some blood
mixture, it would seem, must have developed. The Indian neighbors
show it, and it would be strange if it remained one-sided. But of a
mixture extensive enough to have materially modified the type of
the Eskimo in whole large regions, such as the entire Bering Sea and
most of the far northeast, there is no evidence and little not only
probability but even possibility. Nothing approaching such an extensive
mixture is shown by the near-by Indians; and it would be
most exceptional in people of this nature if a much greater proportion
of the mixture was into the Eskimo.</p>

<p>Finally, a mixture of diverse human types, unless very old, may be
expected to leave numerous physical signs of heterogeneity and
disturbance, none of which is shown by either the western or eastern
Eskimo. Such groups as that of the St. Lawrence Island, or that
of Greenland, are among the most homogeneous human groups
known. The range of variation of their characters is as a rule a
strictly normal range, giving a uniform curve of distribution, which
is not consistent with the notion of any relatively recent material
mixture.</p>

<p>4. <em>The indications.</em>&mdash;The indications of the data and observations
presented in this volume may be outlined as follows:</p>

<p>The Eskimo throughout their territory are but one and the same
broad strain of people. This strain is fundamentally related to that
(or those) of the American Indian. It is also uncontestably related
to the yellow-brown strains of Asia.</p>

<p>In many respects, such as pigmentation, build of the body, physiognomy,
large brain, fullness of forehead, fullness of the fronto-sphenotemporal
region, largeness of face and lower jaw, height of the nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
size and characteristics of the teeth,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> smallness of hands and feet,
etc., the Eskimos are remarkably alike over their whole territory.
They differ in details, such as stature, form of the head, and breadth
of the nose. But the distribution of these differences is of much
interest and probably significance. Higher statures, broader heads,
and broader noses are found especially in the west, the latter two
particularly in the Bering Sea region; low group statures, narrow
heads and narrow noses reach, with few exceptions, their extremes
in the northeast. Between the two extremes, however, there is no
interruption, but a gradation, with here and there an irregularity.
These conditions speak not of mixture but rather of adaptation and
differentiation.</p>

<p>They strongly suggest a moderate stream of people, rooted in Asia,
of fairly broad and but moderately high head, of a good medium
stature, with a mesorrhinic nose (and hence probably originally not
far northern), and with many other characteristics in common, reaching
America from northeasternmost Asia after the related Indians,
spreading along the seacoasts as far as it could, not of choice, or choice
alone, but mainly because of the blocking by the Indian of the roads
toward the south and through the interior; and gradually modifying
physically in adaptation to the new conditions and necessities; to
climate, newer modes of life, the demands of the kayak, and above
all to the results of the increased demands on the masticatory organs.</p>

<p>The narrowness, increased length and increased height of the
Eskimo skull, without change in its size or other characteristics, may
readily be understood as compensatory adaptations, the development
of which was initiated and furthered by the development and
mechanical effects of the muscles of mastication.</p>

<p>A similar conclusion has been reached in my former study on the
central and Smith Sound Eskimo (1910). It has been approached
or reached independently by other students of the Eskimo, notably
Fürst and Hansen (1915) in their great work on the East Greenlanders.
It is a conclusion of much biological importance for it
involves not merely the development but also the eventual inheritance
of new characters.</p>

<p>Former authors, it was seen, have advanced the theories of an
American origin of the Eskimo. This could only mean that he
developed from the American Indian. And such a development
would imply physical and hereditary changes at least as great as
those indicated in the preceding paragraphs, and in less time. A
differentiation commenced well back in Asia, geographically and
chronologically, and advancing, to its present limits, in America
would seem the more probable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>
<p>An origin of the Eskimo in Europe, during the last glacial invasion,
would not only push into the hazy far past the same changes as
here dealt with, but it would at the same time fail to explain the
physical differences within the Eskimo group, and deny any substantial
changes in him during the long time of his migration
toward the American northern coasts.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figure 29.</span>&mdash;Probable movements of people from northeastern Asia to Alaska and in
Alaska. (A. Hrdlička)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Absolute proofs of the origin of the Eskimo, as of that of the
various strains of the Indians, are hardly to be expected. Such origins
are so gradual and insidious that they would escape detection
even if watched for while occurring; they are noticed only after sufficient
differences have developed and become established, which takes
generations. The solving of racial origins must depend on sound
scientific induction.</p>

<p>Such induction may not yet be fully possible in the case of the
Eskimo. The evidence is not yet complete. But with the present
and other most recent data there is enough on hand for substantial
indications. The evidence shows that barring some irregularities,
due possibly to later intrusions or refluxes, the farther east in the
Eskimo territory the observer proceeds the more highly differentiated
and divergent the Eskimo becomes, and there is a greater gap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
between him and his Indian neighbors, as well as other races.
Proceeding from the east westward, conditions are reversed. In
general the farther west we proceed the less exceptional on the
whole the Eskimo becomes and the more he approximates the Indian,
particularly the Indian of Alaska and the northwest coast. As this
can not, in the light of present evidence, be attributed alone to mixture,
it is plain that if it were possible to proceed a few steps farther
in this direction the differences between the Eskimo and the Indian
would fade out so that a distinction between the two would become
difficult if not impossible.</p>

<p>The facts point, therefore, to an original identity of the source
from which were derived the Indian, more particularly his latest
branches, and the Eskimo, and to the identification of this source with
the palaeo-Asiatic yellow-brown people of lower northern Asia. The
differentiation of the Eskimo from this source must have proceeded
over a fairly long time, and probably started already it would seem
on the northern coasts of Asia, where conditions were present capable
of beginning to shape him into an Eskimo; to be carried on since in
the Bering Sea area and especially in the Seward Peninsula and
farther northward and eastward. In a larger sense the cradle of
the Eskimo, therefore, while starting probably in northeast Asia,
covered in reality a much vaster region, extending from northern
Asia and the Bering Sea to the far American Arctic.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>


<p>What is the substance of the results of all these new observations
and studies on the western Eskimo, who is the main subject of
this report? In large lines this may be outlined as follows:</p>

<p>1. The western Eskimo occupied, uninterrupted by other people
(save in a few spots by the Aleuts), the great stretch of the Alaskan
coast from Prince William Sound and parts of the Unalaska Peninsula
to Point Barrow, all the islands in the Bering Sea except the
Aleutians and Pribilovs, and the northern and western coasts of
the Chukchi Peninsula in Asia.</p>

<p>They extended some distance inland along the Kuskokwim and
Yukon Rivers; along the interior lakes and rivers of the Seward
Peninsula; along a part of the Selawik River, most (perhaps) of the
Kobuk River, and apparently along the whole Noatak River, communicating
over the land with the lower Colville Basin. But no
traces of original Eskimo settlements have ever been found in the
true Alaska inland or along those parts of the Alaska rivers that
constitute the Indian territory.</p>

<p>2. The present population is sparse, with many unpeopled intervals,
and not highly fecund, but, except when epidemics strike, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
no more diminishes; children and young people are now much in
evidence, hygienic and economic conditions have improved, and the
people in general are well advanced in civilization. Their condition
and morale are rather superior, in places very perceptibly so, to
those of the majority of the Alaska Indians.</p>

<p>3. Except where there has been more contact with whites, a
large percentage of these Eskimo are still full bloods. They are a
sturdy, cheerful, and liberal yet shrewd lot. They intermarry and
mix not inconsiderably among themselves (between villages). Some
of the white traders have married Eskimo women and raised promising
families. Where larger numbers of whites were or are in proximity
clandestine mixture is apparent. The better educated show
often decidedly good mental, mechanical, business, and artistic abilities.
In the isolated localities, such as St. Lawrence Island, the
people have apparently escaped the period of demoralization that so
often attends the passing from the old to new conditions.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis and venereal diseases are present but not prevalent;
rachitis seems absent. The people show much endurance, but longevity
as yet is not much in evidence. Alcoholism is almost nonexistent
except on occasions when drink is provided by whites.</p>

<p>4. The region of the western Eskimo shows a former larger population
of the same people. This is attested by many "dead" villages
and old sites. And this population evidently goes back some centuries
at least, for some of the remains are extensive and both their
depth and their contents give the impression of prolonged duration;
though seemingly all thus far seen could be comprised within the
Christian era.</p>

<p>5. No habitations or remains belonging to a distinct people (Indians)
have thus far come to light anywhere within the territory
of the western Eskimo; and no trace has as yet been found of
anything human that could be attributed to greater antiquity than
that of the Eskimo. But the older beaches and banks where such
remains might have existed have either been covered with storm-driven
sands and are now perpetually frozen, or they have been
"cut" away and lost; and there seems no hope for finding such remains
in the interior away from the sea or streams, for such parts
were never under recent geological conditions favorable for human
habitation.</p>

<p>6. The now known remains consist of the ruins of dwellings and
of accumulated refuse, the two together forming occasionally marked
elevated heaps or ridges. Some of these ridges are over 18 feet deep.
They contain many archeological specimens of stone, ivory, wood, and
bone. The ivory in the older layers is more or less "fossilized." The
upper layers of such remains usually contain some articles of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
man's manufacture (copper, iron, beads); lower layers are wholly
aboriginal. Indian artifacts occur in Eskimo sites only in the
proximity of the Indian on the rivers.</p>

<p>7. The prevalent or later culture shown by the remains is fairly
rich, of good to relatively rather high grade, and of considerable uniformity.
There are numerous indications of extensive trade in
various articles, particularly those of the Kobuk "jade."</p>

<p>8. On the Asiatic coast, in the northern parts of the Bering Sea,
on the Seward Peninsula, in the Kotzebue region and at Point Hope,
the deeper portions of the remains give examples of the higher
and richer "fossil ivory culture." This is distinguished by many
objects of high-class workmanship, and by curvilinear to scroll designs.
The art appears to have distinct affinities with, on one hand,
deeper Asia, and on the other with the northwest coast of America
and even farther south. It is not clearly separated from either the
contemporaneous or the later Eskimo art, yet it is of a higher grade
and delicacy and much distinctiveness. It is not yet known where
this art begins geographically, what preceded it, whence it was
derived, just how far it reached along the coasts, or even what was
its main center. It seems best for the present to reserve to it the
name of the "fossil ivory art" (rather than Jenness's too limiting
"Bering Sea culture"), and to defer all conclusions concerning it to
the future.</p>

<p>9. It seems justifiable, however, to point to the significance of what
is already known. This "fossil ivory art" especially, but also the
general culture of the western Eskimo, are highly developed and
differentiated cultures, denoting considerable cultural background,
extended duration, and conditions generally favorable to industrial
and artistic developments. It has, it is already ascertained, certain
affinities in Asia. If this art and the attending culture were
advancing toward America, as seems most probable, then the question
of cultural influences and introductions from Asia to America
will have to be reopened.</p>

<p>10. Due to the perpetually frozen ground and the consequent
necessity of surface burials, the area of the western Eskimo was,
until recently, relatively rich in skeletal remains lying on the surface.
It is no more so now, due to storms, beasts, missionaries,
teachers, and scientific collectors. But while only a scattering remains
of the surface material, there is much and that of special
importance lying in the ground, mostly self-buried or assimilated by
the tundra. This material, which now and then is accompanied by
interesting archeological specimens, calls for prompt attention; it
will help greatly in clearing local and other problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally burials were made or dead bodies were left in old
houses. These remains, too, may prove of special value.</p>

<p>11. Observations on both the living and the skeletal remains in
the western Eskimo area, supplemented by those on the northern
and northeastern Eskimo, are now ample enough to justify certain
generalizations. These are:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Barring the Aleuts, who are Indian, the Eskimo throughout
belong somatologically to but one family, and this family appears
as a remarkably pure racial unit, somewhat admixed in the south
with the Aleut, on the western rivers with the Indian, and in the
east and a few spots elsewhere with recent white people.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Within this family there is observable a considerable cranial
change, with moderate differences in nasal breadth, stature, and
color, but the general characteristics of the physiognomy, and of the
body and the skeleton, remain remarkably similar.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The changes in the skull affect mainly the vault, which, in dimensions,
ranges through all the intermediary grades from moderately
broad, short, and moderately high to pronouncedly narrow,
long, and high, and in form from moderately convex over the top to
markedly keel shaped.</p>

<p>The distribution of skull form is somewhat irregular, but in general
the broader and shorter heads predominate in the Asiatic and
the southwestern and midwestern American portions of the Eskimo
region, while the longest and narrowest heads are those of parts of
the Seward Peninsula, and especially those from an isolated old
settlement near Barrow with those of Greenland (exclusive of the
Smith Sound), Baffin Land, and, judging from other data, also eastern
Labrador. More or less transitional forms are found between
the two extremes, without there being anywhere a clear line of
demarcation.</p>

<p>The breadth of the nose, too, averages highest in the Asiatic, Bering
Sea, and the more southern Eskimo of the Alaska coast, the least
along the northern Arctic coast and in the northeast. The stature
is highest along the western Alaska rivers and parts of the coast,
least in Greenland and Labrador.</p>

<p>The skin, while differing within but moderate limits, is apparently
lightest along parts (at least) of the northern Arctic.</p>

<p>12. The whole distribution of the physical characteristics among
the Eskimo strongly suggests gradual changes&mdash;within the family
itself; and as the long, narrow, high skull with keeled dome, occurring
in a few limited localities in the west but principally in southern
Greenland and neighboring territories, appears to be the farthest
limit of the differentiation which finds no parallel in the neighboring
or other peoples, while the form found in northeastern Asia, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Bering Sea, and southwestern Alaska is near to those of various surrounding
peoples, the inevitable resulting deduction is that, in the
light of our present knowledge, the origin of the Eskimo is to be
looked for in the western rather than the northern Arctic or the
northeastern area, and that particularly in the northern Bering Sea
and the adjacent, particularly perhaps the northern, Asiatic region.
The author is, therefore, led to regard the area between 160° west
and 160° east longitude and 60° to 75° north latitude as containing
the primal Eskimo-genic center, and as the source of the oldest
Eskimo or proto-Eskimo extensions, while the larger part of the
Eskimo differentiations is in all probability American.</p>

<p>13. The earlier notions relating to the western Eskimo, namely,
those that would attribute his physical characteristics to a large
admixture with the Indian, are now untenable for the following
reasons:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> The distribution of the western Eskimo traits and measurements
does not indicate any important heterogeneous mixture.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The groups most distant from the Indians, such as the St.
Lawrence or Diomede islanders and the Asiatic Eskimo, show very
nearly the same somatological characteristics as the rest of the
southwestern and midwestern groups.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Among the western Eskimo there are no data, no traditions, and
no linguistic or cultural evidence of any considerable Indian
admixture.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> The western contingents of the family do not represent a physical
resultant or means of the more narrow and long-headed type
with the neighboring Indians of Alaska (or elsewhere in the north),
but they equal or even exceed the Indians in the principal features of
the skull, face, and in other particulars.</p>

<p>14. The nearest physical relatives of the Eskimo are evidently some
of the Chukchi, with probably some other north Asiatic groups; their
nearest basic relatives in general are, according to many indications,
the American Indians. The two families, Indian and Eskimo,
appear much, it may be repeated, like the thumb and fingers of one
and the same hand, the hand being the large, original palaeo-Asiatic
source of both. But the Eskimo are evidently a younger, smaller and
still a more uniform member; which speaks strongly for their later
origin, migration and internal differentiation.</p>

<p>15. With his numbers, purity of blood, approachability, present
facilities of language, many of the young speaking good English,
and other favorable conditions, the Eskimo offers to anthropology
one of its best opportunities for a thorough study of an important
human group, adapted to highly exceptional natural conditions. His
food, mode of life, the climate, and isolation, give promise of inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>esting
conditions of the internal organs, perhaps even blood, and of
physiological as well as chemical and pathological peculiarities. This
opportunity, together with the excellent and important opportunities
for archeology in the Bering Sea and neighboring regions, should be
utilized to the possible limit within the present generation, for the
western Eskimo, on one hand, is rapidly becoming civilized, changing
his food, clothing, housing, and habits; is also becoming more mixed
with whites; and is most assiduously exploiting the archeological
sites in his region for the sake of the income that comes to him from
the ever-rising demand for beads, etc., and from "fossil" ivory.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
